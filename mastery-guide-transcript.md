Part 1: The Framework
Before looking for any trade, you must understand where the market wants to go. This section establishes the foundation that every trade decision builds upon.

FOUNDATION
1.1 Top-Down Analysis (TDA)
Top-Down Analysis is the process of reading market structure from the highest timeframes down to your entry timeframe. The highest timeframes dictate direction; lower timeframes provide precision.

The Core Principle: Higher timeframes ALWAYS take priority. If the weekly is bearish, a bullish 15m setup is fighting the current. Align your trades with the bigger picture.
The Three-Tier System
Tier	Timeframes	Purpose	What You're Looking For
Higher (Bias)	Weekly, Daily	Establish directional bias	Trend direction, major PD arrays, key levels
Medium (Setup)	4H, 1H	Find trade setups	Structure (BOS/CHoCH), FVGs, OBs to target
Lower (Entry)	15m, 5m	Execute entries	Entry FVGs, confirmation patterns, precise timing
TDA Flow: Weekly → Daily → 4H → 15m → 5m

WEEKLY                DAILY                 4H                   15M                  5M

ALIGNMENT
1.2 Timeframe Alignment
Your trade has the highest probability when ALL timeframes point in the same direction. If they conflict, sit out.

Aligned = Trade
Weekly: Bullish (uptrend)
Daily: Bullish (price in/above FVG)
4H: Bullish (CHoCH to upside)
15m: Bullish FVG forming
→ Take the long
Misaligned = No Trade
Weekly: Bullish (uptrend)
Daily: Bullish (price above FVG)
4H: Bearish (CHoCH to downside)
15m: Bearish structure
→ Wait for realignment
Timeframe Pairing Guide
Use these pairings for setup → entry alignment:

If You Identify Setup On	Look For Entry On	Use Case
Monthly	Daily	Position/Swing trades
Weekly	4H	Swing trades
Daily	1H - 15m	Day trades (our focus)
4H	15m - 5m	Day trades (our focus)
1H	5m - 1m	Scalps
PROCESS
1.3 Establishing Directional Bias
Before each session, go through this process to determine your bias for the day:

1
Check Weekly Structure
Is price in an uptrend (higher highs, higher lows) or downtrend (lower highs, lower lows)? Is there a weekly FVG or OB nearby that price might target? This gives you the macro direction.
2
Check Daily Structure
Mark PDH (Previous Day High) and PDL (Previous Day Low). Is there a daily FVG? Has it been mitigated or is it fresh? Where did yesterday close relative to its range? This gives you the immediate context.
3
Check 4H Structure
What's the current 4H order flow? Look for the most recent BOS or CHoCH. Is there a 4H FVG that price is approaching? The 4H tells you what's happening RIGHT NOW.
4
Identify Key Levels
Mark the levels price is likely to target: PDH/PDL, session highs/lows, unfilled FVGs, unmitigated OBs. These become your targets and reversal zones.
5
Form Your Narrative
Based on steps 1-4, what's the most likely scenario? Example: "Weekly bullish, daily pulled back into FVG, 4H showing CHoCH back to bullish. Looking for longs targeting PDH." This is your bias.
If you can't form a clear narrative, don't trade. Confused charts create confused traders. Wait for clarity.
Part 2: Core Concepts
These are the building blocks of Smart Money Concepts. Master each one before moving to setups.

CORE
2.1 External vs Internal Liquidity
Everything in SMC revolves around two types of liquidity. Understanding this is the foundation of everything else.

Type	What It Is	Examples	Your Role
External Liquidity	Swing highs/lows where stop losses cluster. These are TARGETS.	PDH, PDL, swing highs/lows, session highs/lows, ORB high/low	TARGET these for exits
Internal Liquidity	Imbalance zones that act as fuel for moves. These are ENTRIES.	Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), Order Blocks (OBs)	ENTER at these zones
The Master Principle: Price moves FROM internal liquidity TO external liquidity. Your job: Enter at internal (FVG/OB), exit at external (PDH/PDL/swing).
Price Flow: Internal → External
EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY (Target)

ENTRY ZONE
2.2 Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
A Fair Value Gap is a 3-candle pattern where the wicks of candle 1 and candle 3 don't overlap, leaving an imbalance. This imbalance acts as a magnet - price wants to return and fill it.

FVG Formation
BULLISH FVG

GAP = FVG

BEARISH FVG
C1

C3
GAP = FVG
Bullish FVG: Gap between C1 high wick and C3 low wick  |  Bearish FVG: Gap between C1 low wick and C3 high wick

The 7 FVG Rules
1. Align with Order Flow
Only use bullish FVGs in uptrends, bearish FVGs in downtrends. Never trade against the current direction.
2. Never Use Mitigated FVGs
Once price touches an FVG (even barely), it's weakened. Only trade fresh, untouched gaps.
3. Target Premium/Discount
For longs: FVGs in discount (lower half). For shorts: FVGs in premium (upper half).
4. Stack Timeframes
Find a 4H FVG, then drop to 15m to find a smaller FVG inside it. Precise entry with HTF confluence.
5. Check the 3rd Candle
If 3rd candle continues = "breakaway gap" (STRONG). If 3rd candle reverses = "rejection gap" (WEAK - avoid).
6. FVGs at Runs are Strongest
If an FVG forms during a breakout through a key level (liquidity run), it's the highest probability.
7. Avoid Consolidation FVGs
If FVGs keep failing both ways, you're in chop. Wait for two consecutive FVGs to be respected.
Breakaway Gap (Trade) vs Rejection Gap (Avoid)

ENTRY ZONE
2.3 Order Blocks (OBs)
An Order Block is the last opposing candle(s) before an impulsive move. It represents where institutions placed their orders - and where they'll defend price if it returns.

Key Distinction: A bullish OB is made of bearish candles (the last sellers before buyers took over). A bearish OB is made of bullish candles (the last buyers before sellers took over).
Order Block Formation

Order Block Rules
Must Be Validated by BOS
It's not an OB until price breaks the highest wick (bullish) or lowest wick (bearish). Before BOS, it's just candles.
Use Bodies, Not Wicks
Mark from first candle's OPEN to last candle's CLOSE. The bodies define the zone, not the wicks.
Candles Must Be Sequential
No opposing colored candles in between. If a bullish candle interrupts bearish ones, the sequence breaks.
Only Use Unmitigated OBs
Once price touches an OB, it's "used up." The orders are filled. Never trade the same OB twice.
50% Level is Strongest
The midpoint of the OB typically sees the strongest reactions. Consider this your optimal entry within the OB.
Must Form From a PDA
High-probability OBs form after sweeps, at FVG rejections, or at key levels. Random OBs without context are weaker.
STRUCTURE
2.4 Break of Structure (BOS) and Change of Character (CHoCH)
These two concepts tell you whether the trend is continuing or potentially reversing.

BOS - Break of Structure
Price breaks a swing high (bullish) or swing low (bearish), confirming trend continuation.

• Bullish BOS = Price breaks above previous swing high
• Bearish BOS = Price breaks below previous swing low

BOS validates the trend. Trade in BOS direction.
CHoCH - Change of Character
The first break against the current trend. Signals potential reversal.

• Bullish CHoCH = First break above swing high in a downtrend
• Bearish CHoCH = First break below swing low in an uptrend

CHoCH is a warning. Wait for confirmation before trading reversal.
The Reversal Sequence: Sweep → CHoCH → BOS → Entry
PDH (External Liquidity)

but closes BELOW
= Reversal signal
Swing Low

First break below
previous swing low
Wait here - don't enter yet
FVG
Bearish FVG forms
= Entry zone
BOS
Break below CHoCH low
= Trend confirmed bearish
NOW enter short
at FVG retest
The Silver Bullet: The first FVG that forms after a CHoCH (during the move that creates the CHoCH) is called the "Silver Bullet." It's the highest probability entry FVG because it marks the start of the new trend.
ZONES
2.5 Premium and Discount Zones
Every range (whether a swing, an FVG, or an OB) can be divided into premium and discount zones. This helps you get optimal entries.

Premium vs Discount
Swing High
PREMIUM ZONE
(Above 50%)
Shorts enter here - Price is "expensive"
50% Line
DISCOUNT ZONE
(Below 50%)
Longs enter here - Price is "cheap"
Swing Low
Short here
Long here
For LONGS: Look for bullish FVGs/OBs in the DISCOUNT zone
For SHORTS: Look for bearish FVGs/OBs in the PREMIUM zone
Apply to Everything: Premium/Discount applies to the overall swing, to individual FVGs, and to OBs. An FVG in the discount zone of a larger swing, with your entry in the discount zone of that FVG = stacked confluence.
HIGHEST PROBABILITY
2.6 Golden Zones (OB + FVG Overlap)
When an Order Block has a Fair Value Gap overlapping it, you have the highest probability entry zone possible. This is where institutions have both unfilled orders AND an imbalance to fill.

Golden Zone Formation

The GOLDEN ZONE is where FVG and OB overlap.
This is your highest probability entry point.
Prioritize these setups above all others.
Golden Zone Priority: When you see a Golden Zone, it takes priority over regular FVGs or OBs. Enter here with more confidence - you can use tighter stops and/or larger position size (within risk rules).
Part 3: The Three Setups
Now that you understand the concepts, here's how they combine into tradeable setups.

SETUP 1
Sweep Setup (CRT Reversal)
The Sweep Setup is a reversal play. You're looking for price to sweep external liquidity, fail to continue, and reverse. This uses Candle Range Theory (CRT) principles.

When to Use
→ Price approaches a key level (PDH, PDL, swing high/low)
→ Higher timeframe shows potential reversal zone (weekly/daily FVG or OB)
→ You want to catch a reversal, not ride a continuation
The AMD Framework
Sweep setups follow the AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) pattern:

A - Accumulation
Price consolidates, building energy. Often happens pre-market or early session. Range forms.
M - Manipulation
Price SWEEPS external liquidity (wicks beyond the level) but fails to CLOSE beyond it. This is the trap.
D - Distribution
Price reverses hard in the opposite direction. This is where you trade - enter on the FVG formed during CHoCH.

Sweep Setup Checklist
HTF Alignment: Is there a reason for reversal on higher TF? (Weekly/Daily at FVG, OB, or key level)
External Liquidity Swept: Did price wick through the level but FAIL to close beyond?
CHoCH Formed: Has price broken the first swing in the opposite direction?
FVG Present: Is there a fresh FVG in the move that created the CHoCH?
Premium/Discount: Is the FVG in the correct zone? (Premium for shorts, Discount for longs)
Golden Zone? Does the FVG overlap with an OB? (Bonus confluence)
Entry Execution
1
Wait for the Sweep
Don't anticipate. Wait for price to actually sweep the level and fail to close beyond.
2
Wait for CHoCH
On 15m or 5m, wait for the first break of structure in the reversal direction. This confirms buyers/sellers have stepped in.
3
Mark the FVG
The FVG that formed during the CHoCH move is your entry zone. Wait for price to retrace into it.
4
Enter at FVG
Enter when price touches the FVG. Stop beyond the sweep high/low. Target the opposite external liquidity (PDL if short, PDH if long).
Primary Window: 10:00 - 11:30 AM ET. The 10 AM reversal is one of the most reliable times for sweeps. The morning move often sweeps overnight highs/lows before reversing.
SETUP 2
Run Setup (Continuation)
The Run Setup is a continuation play. Price breaks through external liquidity with strength (closes beyond, not just wicks), confirming trend continuation. You enter on the pullback to the FVG created during the breakout.

When to Use
→ Strong trend in place (all timeframes aligned)
→ Price CLOSES beyond external liquidity (not just wicks through)
→ FVG forms during or immediately after the breakout
Run vs Sweep - The Key Difference:
SWEEP: Wicks through level, closes back inside → REVERSAL
RUN: Closes through level with FVG → CONTINUATION

Run Setup Checklist
HTF Trend Clear: Is the weekly/daily trend supporting continuation in this direction?
Strong Close: Did price CLOSE beyond the external liquidity level (not just wick)?
FVG Created: Is there an FVG that formed during or right after the breakout?
FVG Position: Is the FVG at or overlapping the broken level? (Strongest setup)
Clear Target: Is there clear external liquidity above/below to target?
Entry Execution
1
Confirm the Run
Wait for a candle to CLOSE beyond the external liquidity level. A wick above isn't enough - the body must close beyond.
2
Identify the FVG
Mark the FVG that formed during the breakout move. The best FVGs overlap with the broken level itself.
3
Wait for Retest
Price will often pull back to "retest" the breakout level / FVG. This is your entry.
4
Enter at FVG
Enter when price touches the FVG. Stop below the FVG (for longs). Target: Next external liquidity.
FVGs at Runs are the Strongest: An FVG that forms while price is breaking through a key level has the highest probability of being respected. Institutions are defending the breakout.
SETUP 3
ORB Setup (Opening Range Breakout)
The ORB Setup uses the first 15 minutes of the NY session (9:30-9:45 AM) to define a range. You trade the breakout of this range, with direction confirmed by 4H bias.

When to Use
→ Every day at NY open (9:30 AM ET)
→ 4H bias is clear (you know which direction to favor)
→ Opening range is reasonable (not too wide, not too tight)

ORB works best when filtered by the 4H bias:

4H Bias	ORB Action	Expectation
Bullish	Only trade ORB HIGH breakouts	Ignore bearish breakouts or fade them
Bearish	Only trade ORB LOW breakouts	Ignore bullish breakouts or fade them
Unclear	Skip ORB entirely	Wait for Sweep or Run setups instead
ORB Setup Checklist
Range Marked: Mark the high and low of the 9:30-9:45 candle (15m timeframe)
Range Width: Is the range reasonable? (Under 40 points ideal; over 60 = too wide, skip)
4H Bias Known: Do you have a clear 4H directional bias?
Breakout Confirmed: Did a candle CLOSE beyond the ORB level (not just wick)?
Breakout Direction Aligned: Does the breakout match your 4H bias?
FVG Present: Is there an FVG in the breakout move for entry on retest?
Entry Options
Option 1: Breakout Entry
Enter as soon as candle closes beyond ORB level. Fastest but highest risk of false breakout.
Option 2: Retest Entry (Preferred)
Wait for price to pull back and retest the ORB level or FVG. Better R:R, less false breakouts.
Option 3: Confirmation Entry
Wait for retest AND a new higher high/lower low. Most conservative, might miss some moves.
Primary Window: 9:45 - 10:30 AM ET. The ORB breakout typically happens within the first hour. If no breakout by 10:30, the setup weakens - consider Sweep or Run setups instead.
Part 4: Execution
You have the concepts and setups. Now here's how to actually execute trades.

PROCESS
4.1 Entry Execution Process
Regardless of which setup you're trading, the entry process follows the same steps:

1
Confirm HTF Bias
Check weekly → daily → 4H. Are they aligned? What's the most likely direction? If unclear, don't trade.
2
Identify Setup Type
What's happening at external liquidity? Sweep (reversal)? Run (continuation)? ORB breakout? This determines your approach.
3
Wait for Structure Confirmation
For Sweep: Wait for CHoCH. For Run: Wait for close beyond level. For ORB: Wait for close beyond range. Don't anticipate.
4
Locate Entry Zone
Find the FVG (or OB) that you'll use for entry. Is it in the correct zone (premium for shorts, discount for longs)? Is there a Golden Zone?
5
Define Stop Loss
Place stop beyond the FVG/OB (for longs: below; for shorts: above). Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade.
6
Define Target
Target the next external liquidity level. PDH/PDL, session high/low, or the next swing point. Calculate R:R before entering.
7
Execute
Enter when price touches your entry zone. Set stop and target. Don't move stop to "give it room" - either the setup works or it doesn't.
TIMING
4.2 Session Structure (9:30 AM - 1:30 PM ET)
Your 4-hour trading window has distinct phases. Knowing what to expect when helps you prepare for the right setups.

9:30 - 10:00
ORB Formation
Mark the 15m ORB range. Observe initial direction. Don't trade yet - let structure develop. Watch for early sweep attempts.
10:00 - 10:30
Reversal Watch Zone
The famous "10 AM reversal" window. Watch for sweeps of overnight high/low or PDH/PDL. If ORB breaks, this is often when it happens. Primary Sweep setup window.
10:30 - 12:00
Primary Trading Window
Structure has developed. Execute on confirmed setups. ORB retests, Sweep continuations, and Run entries all viable. This is where most of your trades happen.
12:00 - 12:45
Lunch Lull (Caution)
Lower volume, choppier price action. Avoid new entries. Manage existing positions. If you're flat, stay flat until 12:45+.
12:45 - 1:30
Closing Window
Consider taking profits on open positions. Watch for late continuation or end-of-session moves. 4H candle closes at 1:30 - can trigger volatility.
CHECKLIST
4.3 Pre-Trade Checklist
Run through this before every trade:

HTF Bias Clear? Weekly and Daily point the same direction. I know if I'm looking for longs or shorts.
4H Aligned? 4H structure confirms the HTF bias. No conflicting CHoCH.
Setup Identified? I know which setup I'm trading: Sweep, Run, or ORB.
Structure Confirmed? CHoCH (for Sweep) or close beyond level (for Run/ORB) has occurred. Not anticipating.
Entry Zone Valid? Fresh FVG or OB. In premium (shorts) or discount (longs). Golden Zone if available.
Stop Defined? Stop is beyond the entry zone. Risk is within my rules ($200-400 for MFF).
Target Defined? Clear external liquidity target. R:R is at least 1.5:1, ideally 2:1+.
Timing Appropriate? Not in lunch lull (12:00-12:45). Within my session window (9:30-1:30).
If any box is unchecked, don't take the trade. There will always be another setup. Patience and discipline beat frequency.
Part 5: Trade Examples
Let's walk through each setup type with a detailed example.

Example 1: Sweep Setup (Bearish Reversal)
Type
Sweep
Direction
Short
R:R
2.5:1
Scenario
It's 10:15 AM. Weekly is bearish (in a downtrend). Daily shows price pulled up into a bearish FVG yesterday. 4H shows price approaching PDH with momentum slowing. The 9:30 session opened and pushed up, now testing PDH.

What Happens
1
Sweep Occurs at 10:12 AM
Price wicks above PDH but the 5m candle closes back below. The sweep is confirmed - bulls failed to hold above the level.
2
CHoCH Forms at 10:18 AM
On the 5m chart, price breaks below the previous swing low, creating a CHoCH. A bearish FVG forms in the move down.
3
Entry Zone Identified
The FVG is in the premium zone (above 50% of the new range). There's also an OB overlapping - Golden Zone confirmed.
4
Entry at 10:25 AM
Price retraces into the Golden Zone. Enter short. Stop above the sweep high (15 points). Target PDL (37 points away). R:R = 2.5:1.
5
Target Hit at 11:45 AM
Price continues lower, hits PDL. Trade closed for +37 points. Risk was 15 points = 2.5R profit.
Example 2: Run Setup (Bullish Continuation)
Type
Run
Direction
Long
R:R
3:1
Scenario
It's 10:45 AM. Weekly is bullish. Daily closed strong yesterday, just below PDH. 4H shows clear bullish BOS with price in an uptrend. The morning session already broke above PDH - this is a potential run, not a sweep.

What Happens
1
Run Confirmed at 10:30 AM
A 15m candle closes above PDH with a strong body. An FVG forms in the breakout candle, overlapping with PDH level.
2
Wait for Retest
Price continues up briefly, then pulls back toward the FVG/PDH level. This is the retest.
3
Entry at 10:52 AM
Price touches the FVG. Enter long. Stop below the FVG (12 points). Target next external liquidity - weekly swing high (36 points away). R:R = 3:1.
4
Target Hit at 12:30 PM
Price respects the FVG and continues higher. Weekly swing high reached. Trade closed for +36 points. Risk was 12 = 3R profit.
Example 3: ORB Setup (Bullish Breakout)
Type
ORB
Direction
Long
R:R
2:1
Scenario
It's 9:45 AM. The first 15m candle just closed. 4H bias is bullish (clear uptrend with bullish BOS). ORB range is 28 points (reasonable width). Price is consolidating within the range.

What Happens
1
ORB Range Marked
ORB High and ORB Low marked from the 9:30-9:45 candle. Range = 28 points. 4H is bullish, so we favor long breakouts.
2
Breakout at 10:05 AM
A 5m candle closes above the ORB High. An FVG forms in the breakout move. Breakout direction matches 4H bias - setup is valid.
3
Entry at 10:12 AM
Price pulls back to retest the ORB High / FVG zone. Enter long. Stop below ORB Low (14 points below entry). Target PDH (28 points away). R:R = 2:1.
4
Target Hit at 11:00 AM
Price respects the retest and continues higher. PDH reached. Trade closed for +28 points. Risk was 14 = 2R profit.

SUMMARY
The Complete Framework
The One-Sentence Summary: Use Top-Down Analysis to find bias, identify what's happening at external liquidity (Sweep, Run, or ORB), then enter at internal liquidity (FVG/OB in the correct zone) and target the next external liquidity.
Layer	Question	Tools
1. Bias (TDA)	Which direction should I trade?	Weekly → Daily → 4H structure
2. Setup Type	What's happening at external liquidity?	Sweep (reversal), Run (continuation), ORB (range break)
3. Entry	Where exactly do I enter?	FVG or OB in Premium (shorts) / Discount (longs). Golden Zone = best.
4. Stop	Where am I wrong?	Beyond entry zone (FVG/OB). Beyond sweep high/low for Sweep setups.
5. Target	Where do I take profit?	Next external liquidity (PDH/PDL, swing H/L, session levels)
Master this framework. Practice it. Trust it.
The edge is in the execution, not the complexity.
