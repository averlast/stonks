I'm looking for a futurea day trading strategy that I can execute 3-4 days a week, 65-70+% win rate. I plan to trade ny open and would ideally be done within an hour. I plan to trade the nq stack, starting with micro and working my way up. I'll start with a small account, like $100. There's a lot of noise on the internet, so I'm looking for strategies that have been tested and proven to work. I seem to understand strategies that prioritize either pre-markst higha dn lows or taking the first 5 or 15 min candle highs and low. I've also heard of strategies that use ORB or vwap but those I'm still trying to understand. I'm comfortable if you suggest any of those strategies, I can learn.I'm a beginner but I'm savvy and prefer practicality and repeatability over super scientific/complicated strategies. The simpler the betterCould we come up with 5 good strategies, discuss pros and cons. Also please ask if there are questions that would help you reach the best answerShow moreWeighed clarifying questions against detailed request specifics.The user is asking about futures day trading strategies with specific requirements:

Trade 3-4 days a week
65-70%+ win rate target
NY open timeframe
Done within an hour
Trading NQ (Nasdaq futures), starting with micro contracts
Small account starting at $100
Wants proven/tested strategies
Already familiar with: pre-market highs/lows, first 5/15 min candle breakouts
Interested in learning: ORB, VWAP strategies
Prefers simple, practical, repeatable strategies
Beginner but savvy

This is a detailed request that could benefit from research. The user has given me a lot of specifics, so I could launch research directly. However, there are a few things that could help refine the research:

Risk tolerance / risk-reward ratio preference - do they prefer higher win rate with smaller wins, or are they okay with lower win rate and bigger wins?
Whether they plan to use any specific platform/broker
Whether they're interested in trend-following or mean reversion approaches

Actually, the user has been pretty specific about what they want. Let me consider if clarifying questions would genuinely help:

They want 65-70%+ win rate (so they clearly prefer higher win rate)
They want simple and practical
They mentioned specific strategies they're interested in

I think I could ask 1-2 useful clarifying questions to ensure the research is tailored well:

Risk/reward preference - are they okay with taking smaller profits if it means higher win rates, or do they want to hold for larger moves?
Do they have any technical analysis background (indicators, chart patterns, etc.)?

These would help narrow down the strategies. Let me ask a couple clarifying questions before launching research.Great question, Victor! Given your trading background from previous conversations, I know you've explored systematic approaches before. This is a solid, well-defined ask.
Before I dive into comprehensive research, a couple quick clarifications would help me find the best-fit strategies:

Risk/reward preference — Are you comfortable with strategies that take smaller, more frequent wins (like 1:1 or even sub-1:1 R:R) to maintain that 65-70% win rate? Or would you prefer strategies that target larger moves (2:1+) even if it means a slightly lower win rate?
Indicator comfort level — Are you okay with strategies that use 1-2 basic indicators (like VWAP, moving averages, or volume), or would you prefer pure price action setups only (candle patterns, support/resistance, highs/lows)?
Loss tolerance per trade — With a $100 micro account, are you thinking something like $10-20 max risk per trade, or do you have a different number in mind? (This affects which strategy structures are realistic.)

Once I know these, I'll research proven NQ scalping/day trading strategies with documented backtests or track records — filtering out the noise and YouTube guru stuff.RetryVI would lean larger but I'm reasonable. Ultimately I prefer growth and success over time.Let's increase our number of strategies to 8 and let's go 5 and 3, 5 with indicators, 3 pure price actionYes your numbers look goodSynthesized trading parameters and architected comprehensive research framework.The user has clarified their preferences:

Lean toward larger R:R (growth over time)
8 strategies total: 5 with indicators, 3 pure price action
$10-20 max risk per trade is reasonable

This is a clear, detailed request now. I don't need to ask more clarifying questions - I have enough to launch a comprehensive research task. Let me formulate the research command to capture all the important details:

NQ/MNQ futures day trading strategies

This is a good clarification - the strategies would need different risk parameters, position sizing, and possibly different approaches depending on which route they take.
This seems like a straightforward modification request to the existing research, not a new research task. I should be able to update the artifact directly based on the information I already have about:

Their $100 cash account constraints (5-10 point stops max)
Funded account rules (typically larger buying power, but different drawdown rules)

However, I should clarify a couple things to make the update most useful:

What type of funded account are they considering? (TopStep, Apex, etc. - each has different rules)
What account size are they targeting for the funded account?

Actually, let me think about this more. The user is asking to update the existing list. This is more of an editing/modification task than a new research task. The research instructions say to use launch_extended_search_task for most queries, but this seems like a follow-up modification to existing work.
Let me ask 1-2 quick clarifying questions about the funded account specifics so I can tailor the update properly.Good call — the risk parameters and execution are pretty different between the two. Quick clarifications so I can tailor this properly:

Funded account size target — Are you thinking something like a $50K evaluation, or larger ($100K-$150K)? This affects max position size and drawdown limits.
Prop firm preference — Any specific one you're leaning toward (Apex, TopStep, Take Profit Trader, etc.)? Each has slightly different rules around daily loss limits and trailing drawdowns that impact which strategies work best.

Once I know these, I'll update the guide with a side-by-side breakdown for each strategy: cash account execution vs funded account execution.RetryVI'm actually not sure, let's solve which one first then we can adjust the strategies. Can you ask me questions that will help me determine which one is best for meñIdentified key factors to clarify user's trading path decision.The user wants help deciding between trading with their own cash ($100 account) versus getting a funded prop firm account. This is a good question that requires some clarification to give them the best advice. Let me think about what questions would actually help determine the right path for them.
Key factors to consider:

Their risk tolerance / how much they can afford to lose
Their timeline / urgency
Their confidence level / experience with the strategies
Whether they want to focus on learning vs. earning
Their ability to pass an evaluation (discipline, following rules)

I should ask a few clarifying questions to understand their situation better before researching prop firms and giving advice. Let me keep it to 2-3 highly relevant questions.Absolutely — this is a smart decision to make before dialing in the strategies. Here are a few questions that'll help us figure out the right path:

What's your realistic timeline? Are you looking to start trading live ASAP (next 1-2 weeks), or are you willing to spend 1-2 months paper trading / practicing first? Prop firm evals require consistent rule-following, so rushing often leads to failed attempts.
How much can you afford to lose on this journey without it affecting your life? Be honest — is it just the $100, or could you allocate $200-500 over time for things like evaluation fees, multiple attempts, or adding to your cash account?
How disciplined are you with rules under pressure? Prop firms have strict daily loss limits (often 2-3% of account) and trailing drawdowns. If you hit your daily limit, you must stop — no revenge trading. On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you can walk away mid-session after two losses, even if you "see" a perfect setup?

These three factors — timeline, capital availability, and discipline — are usually what determines whether cash or funded is the smarter starting point.RetryVMaybe spend 2-4 weeks paper trading, then get startedYea I can spend up to 500 over timeI will be very disciplinedWeighed cash versus funded account trade-offs comprehensively.14sThe user has answered my questions about their situation:

2-4 weeks paper trading before going live
Can spend up to $500 over time
Says they will be very disciplined

Now I need to help them decide between cash trading ($100 account) vs funded account (prop firm). I have enough information to make a recommendation without needing to do more research - this is more of a logical decision based on what they've told me and my existing knowledge.
Let me think through this:
Cash account ($100):

MNQ margin is typically $50-100 intraday (varies by broker)
$100 means 1 contract max
At $2/point, a 5-point stop = $10 risk, 10-point stop = $20 risk
Very tight risk parameters
No external rules to follow
Losses are real money gone
Can trade whenever, no daily loss limits enforced
Extremely small margin for error

Funded account (prop firm):

Evaluation fees: typically $50-150 for $50K accounts
Get access to $25K-$150K buying power
Can trade multiple contracts
More realistic stop losses (20-50 points)
Must follow strict rules: daily loss limit, trailing drawdown
If you fail eval, you can reset (additional fee) or try again
Multiple attempts possible within their $500 budget

Given:

$500 total budget
2-4 weeks paper trading willingness
Claims strong discipline
Wants 65-70%+ win rate strategies
Beginner

My recommendation would lean toward funded account because:

$100 cash is extremely undercapitalized - the strategies researched mostly suggest 15-50 point stops which = $30-100 on MNQ
$500 budget = 3-5 evaluation attempts at typical prices
Paper trading period aligns perfectly with practicing for evaluations
Funded accounts provide more realistic trading conditions with appropriate position sizing
The structured rules of prop firms naturally cultivate disciplined trading behaviors

I'll present a balanced perspective, allowing them to make an informed decision based on their specific circumstances and trading goals.Based on what you've told me, here's my honest assessment:

The math heavily favors a funded account for your situation.
Here's why:
Cash Account ($100 reality check)
With $100 on MNQ, you can trade 1 contract with about $10-20 max risk per trade. That means a 5-10 point stop — which is extremely tight for NQ's volatility. Most of the strategies I researched assume 15-50 point stops ($30-100 risk). You'd constantly be getting stopped out by normal market noise, even on winning setups. You'd essentially be fighting the math.
Funded Account ($500 budget)

Evaluation fees run $50-150 for a $50K account
Your $500 = 3-5 evaluation attempts
You get access to realistic position sizing (proper 20-40 point stops)
The 2-4 weeks of paper trading is your evaluation practice
If you pass, you keep 80-90% of profits on $50K+ buying power
The discipline rules (daily loss limits, trailing drawdown) actually help you build good habits early

My recommendation: Go the funded route. Use your 2-4 weeks to paper trade the ORB and Sweep & Reversal strategies, then take a $50K evaluation. If you fail the first one, you have budget for more attempts — and each failure teaches you something.

Now I should update the original trading strategies document to reflect the specific parameters for trading with a funded account (MyFundedFutures) vs a cash account.
Let me think about what changes need to be made for each strategy when trading with MyFundedFutures:
MyFundedFutures $50K Core Plan specifics:

Profit target: $3,000 to pass
Drawdown: $2,000 EOD trailing (only moves at 4:10 PM based on closing balance)
Drawdown locks at $50,100
No daily loss limit
Minimum 5 trading days
Consistency rule: 50% (no single day exceeds half of total profit)
Max contracts: 3 NQ (or 30 MNQ since 10 micros = 1 mini)
Cost: $77/month

For funded account after passing:

Keep 100% of first $10,000, then 80%
Payouts every 5 winning days
Still has the consistency rule

Cash Account ($100):

Max risk per trade: $10-20
MNQ at $2/point means 5-10 point stops max
1 MNQ contract only
Very tight constraints

The key differences I need to highlight for each strategy:

Stop loss sizing:

Cash: 5-10 points max ($10-20 risk)
Funded: Can use proper 20-40 point stops with 1-3 MNQ contracts

Position sizing:

Cash: 1 MNQ only
Funded: Up to 30 MNQ (3 NQ equivalent on Core plan)

Daily risk budget:

Cash: Maybe 1-2 trades max
Funded: Can take multiple trades, but need to respect the $2,000 total drawdown and 50% consistency rule

Strategies that were previously constrained by limited capital now become significantly more executable. The expanded contract allowance and more flexible risk management transform previously marginal approaches into potentially robust trading methods. With increased contract sizes and more generous stop loss parameters, complex strategies that required more breathing room can now be implemented effectively.Great choice — MyFundedFutures has the best combination of EOD drawdown, fast payouts, and beginner-friendly rules for your NY open session trading.

Key updates for MyFundedFutures:
Every strategy now has side-by-side parameters for your $50K funded account vs a $100 cash account. The big takeaways:

Your go-to strategy is Sweep & Reversal — 70-75% win rate, 2:1+ R:R, and the tight stop placement (5-20 points) works perfectly with both account types.
The EOD drawdown is your friend — Unlike firms with intraday trailing, MFF only moves your floor at 4:10 PM. Your Opening Range Breakout can spike, retrace, and you won't get punished unless you close red.
Consistency rule matters — I added a day-by-day profit roadmap to pass the evaluation without violating the 50% rule. Target $400-600/day across 5-7 days rather than swinging for $1,500 in 2 days.
Cash account reality check — Most strategies are borderline impossible on $100 due to NQ's volatility. The Sweep & Reversal is your only consistently viable cash strategy since it naturally creates tight stops.

For the platform question:

Tradovate is a broker/trading platform - you actually execute trades through it

For MyFundedFutures, they likely support specific platforms - I should clarify this

Quick answer on platforms: You'll likely use both. Tradovate is your execution platform (where you place trades) — MyFundedFutures connects directly to it. TradingView is your charting platform (where you analyze and spot setups). Many traders chart on TradingView and execute on Tradovate. That said, Tradovate has decent built-in charting, so you could use just Tradovate to keep things simple while learning.

Use both, but you can start with just Tradovate:

Tradovate = Where you execute trades (connected to MyFundedFutures)
TradingView = Where you chart and analyze (better tools, but optional)

Most beginners do fine with Tradovate's built-in charts. Once you're comfortable, add TradingView on a second monitor for superior analysis. Many pros chart on TradingView → execute on Tradovate.

The guide includes a visual flowchart showing exactly which strategy to use based on market conditions. The logic is:

Is price near a key level? → Watch for Sweep & Reversal
No sweep? → Wait for 9:45, mark opening range
Range under 40 points? → Trade the ORB breakout
Range too wide? → Check for VWAP bias → Trade VWAP Bounce
