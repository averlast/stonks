# Project state — read this first

Local, single-user **ORB/IB practice simulator**: replay the first 2h of the NY index-futures
open (NQ/ES), commit a plan, trade forward-only with honest fills, then get AI coaching graded on
**process, not outcome**. Status: **design complete, build not started.**

## Where everything lives
- **`SPEC.md`** — the 14 locked decisions + data/fill/grading architecture.
- **`CONTEXT.md`** — the domain glossary (phases, setups, levels, sweeps, scaling, R). Keep current.
- **`docs/adr/0001–0008`** — every design decision and *why*. Read these before changing anything.
- **`docs/study/method.html`** — the trader's own method, for studying (not app design).
- **GitHub `averlast/stonks` issues #1–#19** — the build plan (tracer-bullet vertical slices,
  `agent-ready` label). Issue # = slice #; "Blocked by" links resolve.

## How to resume in a fresh session
1. Skim this file, then `SPEC.md` §1 (locked decisions) and the ADR titles.
2. The critical path to a first graded trade: **#1 → #2 → #3 → (#4 ∥ #5) → #6/#7 → #8.**
3. Build discipline (ADR-0006): prove the **playback + fill engines on the whipsaw day first**,
   then layer on the full environment.

## Next action — issue #8 (grade)
Issues **#1–#7 DONE** + on-chart trade management. Full loop now runs: **Prep gate** (mark levels
+ bias + call, commit freezes & reveals true levels, #7) → **attempt** (playback + tick-resolved
fills + place/manage/exit, sealed as an append-only event log, #5) → **Review** (full-day unlock,
annotated scrub, #6). Next is **#8 — grade** (ADR-0003): the objective Prep report card
(level-marking coverage/precision + bias call) + AI hard/soft synthesis. The frozen prep
(`prep_committed`) and trade tape are both in the event log for the grader to fold.
*Hand-verify pending:* the interactive Prep marking/commit UI (like #3) — boots clean, all
tests pass, but the drag/commit click-through wasn't self-verified.

### #7 level source — RESOLVED (Option C, 2026-07-10)
The "true" pre-session levels the hidden-level drill reveals are now computed by ingestion and
committed as a tracked answer key. `ingestion/fetch_day.py` (+`--no-levels`) folds cheap
`ohlcv-1m` history into **`data/levels/{symbol}-{date}.json`** (minimal real set: `PDH`/`PDL` =
prior RTH day 09:30–16:00; `ONH`/`ONL` = overnight Globex `[prior 18:00, 09:30)`). NQ 2024-08-05
answer key is committed (PDH 18761 / PDL 18385.75 / ONH 18390 / ONL 17351; ~$0.017). PW/PM H/L,
prior VAs, and the Asia/London split (ET windows TBD) extend the same file later.

### #7 outcome (2026-07-10) — Prep gate (ADR-0003)
Prep-UX per the user: mark on the **prior-day chart** (the eval is practising the marking ritual,
not hiding levels), so the drill is coverage/proximity, not a blind precision test.
- **Data layer** (`6972bc3`): ingestion persists prior-RTH-day + overnight 1m bars (gitignored
  `..._presession-1m.parquet`); Rust `load_presession` (ungated context) + `load_levels` (answer
  key). The true-level source is Option C (`data/levels/{symbol}-{date}.json`).
- **Prep model** (`session/events.ts`): `Prep { markedLevels, biasProse, biasCall }` replaces the
  #5 `PrepStub`; `prep_committed` carries it, hashed. `recorder.commitPrep(Prep)`.
- **Marking tool** (`prep/levelMarker.ts`): draggable **level lines** AND **range/zone** marks
  (low/high edges + shaded band), via a **floating toolbar over the chart** (＋ Level / ▭ Range /
  Clear). `ChartView.setLevelLines` draws the revealed true levels as persistent native price
  lines. Prep carries `markedLevels` + `markedZones` (zones AI-graded, not precision-scored).
- **UX revision (2026-07-10, post-hand-test)**: fixed a blank prep chart — the prior-day candles
  now render only once the chart container has a non-zero size (Vite injects CSS via JS, so at
  init the container could measure 0×0 and setData parked the view on empty space). Marking moved
  off the cramped sidebar into the floating toolbar; the manual **order-entry form was removed**
  (trading is chart-first: draw the bracket) — kept side/size/draw/arm/cancel/flatten; sidebar
  widened 260→320px with more gap.
- **Phase machine** (`main.ts`): `phase: "prep" | "attempt" | "review"` (subsumes the old
  `reviewing` flag). On load → **prep**: show the `load_presession` chart (dev degrades to empty),
  lock transport + trading. Prep panel = marks list + prose bias + bull/bear/chop + Commit.
  **Commit** → real `prep_committed` (immutable seal; #5 auto-stub removed) → `load_levels` reveals
  the true levels + a nearest-mark proximity readout → transition to **attempt** (swap to the live
  RTH feed, unlock trading). A second commit is impossible (guarded + marker destroyed).
- **Tests**: TS `npm test` → 29 (session tests updated to the real `Prep`); Rust → 6. Typecheck +
  build clean; app boots clean in Prep. *Interactive drag/commit is a hand-check (repo UX
  convention, like #3).*

### #6 outcome (2026-07-10) — annotated Review scrub (ADR-0002 unlock)
- **The unlock is server-enforced** (`lib.rs`): `Feed.review_unlocked` (re-armed on every
  `set_day`); `unlock_review` drops the wall; **`review_bars`** hands over the full day only once
  unlocked, else `Err` — so the frontend still cannot obtain future price mid-attempt (ADR-0002).
  Rust test `review_bars_are_walled_until_unlocked`.
- **Feed** (`barFeed.ts`): `unlockReview()` / `reviewBars()` on the `BarFeed` interface (Tauri
  invokes; dev returns its in-memory day). **`app/src/review/review.ts` `foldDay(bars, tf)`** folds
  a whole day into the complete candle series (all sealed + final forming) — 3 unit tests.
- **Review mode** (`main.ts`): entered on 11:30 `onEnd` or the new **⏹ End & Review** button (a
  one-way concession — flatten flat, seal, unlock; you can't peek then resume). `enterReview()`
  pauses the clock, folds the full day into all timeframes, `setData`s every candle (native chart
  pan = **bidirectional scrub over the full 2h**), keeps entry/exit/stop markers, and locks
  trading (`syncControls`/submit/F-key/transport all gated by `reviewing`). Trades panel now
  annotates **MAE/MFE** per row. Title shows `· REVIEW`.
- **Tests**: TS `npm test` → 29 (+3 review-fold); Rust `cargo test --lib` → 5 (+review wall).
  Typecheck + prod build clean. App boots clean on the new build. *Interactive scrub/annotation
  is a hand-check (repo convention for UX slices).*

### #5 outcome (2026-07-10) — seal the attempt (ADR-0005)
- **Session module** (`app/src/session/`, portable TS): `events.ts` = the typed `SessionEvent`
  vocabulary (`session_started`, `prep_committed`, `order_placed`, `order_cancelled`, `fill`,
  `stop_moved`, `flatten`, `trade_closed`, `end_of_day`) + envelope (`seq`, `t` sim-second, `at`
  wall clock), the **`fold(events) → SessionState`** read path, and `hashPrep` (canonical-JSON +
  cyrb53; #7 can swap SHA-256). `recorder.ts` = `SessionRecorder` mapping the engine's moments to
  events with an **order-serialised** async NDJSON sink; `startTauriSession` (Tauri) vs
  `memorySink` (dev/tests).
- **Fill engine emit points** (`fillEngine.ts`): added `onEvent(FillEvent)` emitting at
  `place`/`cancelPending`/entry-fill/exit-fill/`close`. **`stop_moved` is coalesced per bar** —
  a live drag fires `modifyBracket` continuously, so the engine logs only the effective stop that
  guarded each second (at the bar it took effect). `FillReason` gained `"end-of-day"`;
  `flatten(bar, reason)` carries the cause.
- **First repo write path** (`lib.rs`): `start_session` allocates the next attempt via
  `next_attempt` (one past the highest `{symbol}-{n}.ndjson`, `create_new` so a re-practice is a
  **distinct** log, never a clobber) and `append_event` appends one line. Records live at tracked
  `data/sessions/{date}/{symbol}-{attempt}.ndjson` (NOT gitignored). No-peek wall unchanged —
  still Rust-gated (ADR-0002); `reset_feed` stays a dev-only affordance, never called in the app.
- **Auto-flatten at 11:30**: playback `onEnd` now cancels working orders, `flatten(lastBar,
  "end-of-day")` any open position, and seals with an `end_of_day` event. Title shows `· attempt N`.
- **Tests**: TS `npm test` → 26 (+6 session: fold-is-truth, full event order, drag coalescing,
  eod flatten, cancel, prep-hash stability/tamper). Rust `cargo test --lib` → 4 (+attempt
  increment). Typecheck + prod build clean. **Verified live**: real Tauri app booted → wrote
  `data/sessions/2024-08-05/NQ-1.ndjson` with `session_started` + hashed `prep_committed`
  (throwaway record removed).

### #4 outcome (2026-07-10) — true tick-resolution of straddles (ADR-0004)
- **Ingestion**: `fetch_day.py` now also pulls the day's raw `trades` for 09:30–11:30 →
  gitignored `data/bars/NQ/2024-08-05_trades.parquet` (203,374 prints, $0.25). Columns `t`
  (canonical second, matches bars), `ts` (true UTC ns for ordering), `price`. `--no-ticks` to
  skip. All 7,188 bar-seconds have ticks.
- **Rust** (`bars.rs`/`lib.rs`): `load_ticks` builds `second → ordered prices`; `load_day` loads
  it (boot log: `7188 bars, 7188 tick-seconds`); command **`ticks_for_second(t)`** serves one
  reached second (not a peek). Missing cache → empty → pessimistic fallback.
- **Fill engine** (`fillEngine.ts`): `onBar` is now async; a straddle calls the injected
  `StraddleResolver`, walks the prints in order (`firstTouch`), and fills whichever level price
  reached first, flagged `exitMethod: "tick-true"`; no ticks → `"pessimistic"`. `main.ts` wires
  the resolver to `ticks_for_second` under Tauri (browser dev → pessimistic). `PlaybackEngine`
  now awaits the tick subscriber so resolution completes in clock order.
- **Determinism**: tick cache is fixed + ts-ordered → same day replays identically.
- **Tests**: TS `npm test` → 19 (added 3 tick-resolution: target-first, stop-first, fallback);
  Rust `cargo test --lib` → 3 (added tick-cache load-in-order). Typecheck + prod build clean.

### Polish (2026-07-10)
- Price scale is **pinned while drawing a bracket** (`ChartView.setPriceAutoScale`,
  toggled in `BracketEditor.start/cancel`) — kills the line-jitter noticed at 30×.

### Trade management (2026-07-10) — post-#3 UX (confirmed by hand)
- **Manage a live position on the chart**: `BracketEditor` now has a `manage` mode (entry fixed,
  stop/target draggable) that attaches when a position opens; dragging calls
  `FillEngine.modifyBracket({stop,target})` live (OCO, effective next bar). **R stays anchored to
  the initial stop** even after trailing (`initialStop` never rewritten — CONTEXT; unit-tested).
- **Cancel a resting order**: `cancelOrder` button appears for an unfilled working order →
  `FillEngine.cancelPending()`. **Flatten** relabelled "Flatten (F)" + **F key** market-exits.
- `main.ts` `syncControls()` is the single state machine reconciling buttons + overlay vs
  engine state (flat / working order / live position / placement draw).
- *Known cosmetic (user chose to leave it)*: fill markers are bar-relative (LWC has no exact-
  price marker), so a fill dot drifts slightly while its 1m candle is still forming, then locks.
  The trade record's exit price/second are exact regardless. Optional future fix: overlay dots at
  `priceToY(fillPrice)`.

### #3 outcome (2026-07-10) — fill engine (the integrity layer, SPEC §4)
- **`app/src/engine/fillEngine.ts`** — working market/limit/stop-entry orders each with an OCO
  stop+target bracket. Adjudicates each 1s bar in clock order: limits/targets fill clean, stops
  and market/stop-entries take 1-tick slippage, OCO cancels the sibling, a straddle bar (stop AND
  target in one second) resolves **pessimistically (stop first)** and is flagged `exitMethod:
  "pessimistic"`. Trade record carries fills, avg entry, exit, level, reason, MAE/MFE, PnL,
  commissions, and **R anchored to the initial stop** (1R = first-entry $ risk, ADR-0007).
  Single-bracket only for now; fills are an ordered list so scale-in/out layers on unchanged.
- **`app/src/engine/contracts.ts`** — NQ/MNQ/ES/MES specs; `DEFAULT_FILL_CONFIG` = 1-tick
  slippage, $2.50/contract/side commission (both tunable open params).
- **Tests**: `cd app && npm test` → 16 passing (4 aggregator + 12 fill engine covering every #3
  criterion: each entry type, OCO, pessimistic straddle+flag, commission/slippage in PnL, a flat
  stop-out landing slightly worse than −1R, MAE/MFE, short mirror, guards).
- **UI** (`main.ts` + `index.html`): order-ticket sidebar (side/type/entry/stop/target/size),
  Place + Flatten, live position box (unreal R/$, MAE/MFE), trades list (R, $, ⚠ pessimistic
  flag, totals), chart bracket price-lines + fill markers.
- **On-chart bracket editor** (`app/src/trading/bracketEditor.ts`): TradingView-style draggable
  entry/stop/target lines as an HTML overlay on the chart (Lightweight Charts has no native order
  tool). Only the lines capture the mouse so the chart stays pannable; live R:R; entry type
  auto-inferred from entry-vs-price (above=stop/breakout, below=limit/pullback, at=market).
  "Draw on chart" → drag → "Arm bracket". Confirmed working by hand.
  - *Known minor*: lines visually jump as the price axis autoscales while candles print
    (amplified at 30×) — cosmetic; optional fix is to pin the price scale during a draft.

### Toolchain (installed 2026-07-10 — no longer a blocker)
- **Rust** via rustup (user-local, `~/.cargo`, MSVC target), **MSVC C++ Build Tools** (VCTools
  workload), **WebView2** (pre-existing). Run the app: `cd app && npx tauri dev` (needs
  `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH). Plain browser harness still works: `npm run dev` → :5173.

### #2 outcome (2026-07-10)
- **`app/` = Vite + TS + Lightweight Charts v5 frontend; `app/src-tauri/` = Tauri v2 + Rust.**
- **Engine** (`app/src/engine/`): `playback.ts` authoritative 1s sim clock (`step()` the only
  bar-processing path; speed sets only the timer delay — ADR-0002 invariant, unit-tested);
  `aggregator.ts` folds 1s → 1m/5m/15m live candles; `barFeed.ts` picks the Rust `TauriFeed`
  under Tauri, `DevJsonFeed` in a plain browser. TS tests: `cd app && npm test` (4 passing).
- **Rust gated feed** (`app/src-tauri/src/`): `bars.rs` reads the parquet (pure-Rust
  arrow/parquet) using the baked-in `t` column; `lib.rs` owns the bars + a forward-only cursor
  and exposes `load_day` / `next_sim_second` / `reset_feed`. The webview only ever gets the next
  second — no-peek wall enforced in Rust (ADR-0002). Rust tests: `cd app/src-tauri &&
  cargo test --lib` (2 passing: real parquet load + gate invariant). Boot log confirms IPC:
  `load_day NQ 2024-08-05: 7188 bars`.
- **Canonical time**: `fetch_day.py` now bakes a `t` column (ET wall clock as epoch seconds) into
  the parquet, so Rust + TS + chart all use one integer with zero timezone code.
- **Still deferred from #2** (not blocking #3): bundled-app bars path (dev resolves
  repo/data/bars via CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR); macOS launch is architecturally supported but untested
  locally (Windows-only dev box).

### For #3 (fill engine) — where to build
Order/fill logic is portable TS → lives in `app/src/engine/` alongside playback, driven by the
same 1s `Tick` stream. Straddle bars use the pessimistic fallback for now (stop first); true
tick-resolution is #4. Model commissions + 1-tick slippage from day one. Record entry/exit,
level, reason, MAE, MFE, R (R anchored to the initial stop).

### #1 outcome (2026-07-09)
- **Ingestion script:** `ingestion/fetch_day.py` (isolated Python per ADR-0001; `.venv/` +
  `ingestion/requirements.txt`). Runs `metadata.get_cost` first (~$0.03, 400 KB — trivially
  inside the free credit), pulls `ohlcv-1s` for 09:30–11:30 ET via **continuous front-month
  symbology** (`NQ.c.0`, `stype_in=continuous`), writes gitignored Parquet to `data/bars/`, and
  upserts a tracked `data/manifest.json`. Timestamps stored in America/New_York (DST-correct,
  EDT −04:00). DuckDB verify: **7,188 rows** (≈7,200; ~12 thin seconds had no trade).
- **Whipsaw day CONFIRMED — keep NQ 2024-08-05.** First-2h range **680 pts**, net +540;
  first second alone spans 36 pts; **994 one-second bars ≥8 pt, 442 ≥10 pt.** Stops/targets
  placed within ~30 pt *will* be straddled in one second — the hostile input #3/#4 must resolve.
- **Keys:** `.env` (gitignored) has `DATABENTO_API_KEY`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still to add before
  the grading slice (#8). Never paste keys into chat/commits.
- **Not committed yet** — working tree holds `.gitignore`, `ingestion/`, `data/manifest.json`.
- Session-window note: **FOMC = 2pm ET (outside our window); CPI = 8:30am ET (pre-open)** — so a
  volatility/reversal day beats an event day for stressing the *morning* engine.

## Open parameters — decided in shape, numbers still to tune (not forks)
- Bias bull/bear/chop thresholds, scored over the **2h window** (ADR-0003).
- Per-symbol level tolerance for the hidden-drill precision score (a "few points" ≠ same on NQ vs ES).
- Asia/Tokyo & London session **ET windows** (CONTEXT marks TBD).
- Commission per contract (+ default slippage already set: 1 tick on stops).
- The Journal prompt list (structured prompts, ADR-0003 / CONTEXT).
- Volume-zone overlap threshold (~20% of top 3–4 ranges — profiles module).
- AI models: default `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-8` for deep end-of-module coaching (SPEC §5).

## Deferred by design (post-core, in order)
Calendar/module/progression (#17) → volume-profile histogram polish (#14) → micro↔mini (#19).
Base-rate stats (#18) computed **as-of the practiced day, no lookahead** (ADR-0008).
