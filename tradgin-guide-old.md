Part 1: The Concepts
Before executing trades, you need to understand the building blocks. This section covers the "why" behind every setup.

1.1 The Two Types of Liquidity
Everything in this system revolves around two types of liquidity. Understanding this is the foundation of SMC trading.

Type	What It Is	Examples	Role
External Liquidity	Swing highs/lows where stop losses cluster	PDH, PDL, overnight high/low, swing highs/lows	TARGETS - where price is drawn to
Internal Liquidity	Imbalance zones price uses as fuel	FVGs, Order Blocks	ENTRIES - where you take trades
The Core Principle: Price moves FROM internal liquidity TO external liquidity. Your job: Enter at internal liquidity (FVG/OB), exit at external liquidity (PDH/PDL/swing).

1.2 Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
A Fair Value Gap is a 3-candle pattern where the wicks of candle 1 and candle 3 don't overlap, leaving an imbalance zone. The market "wants" to fill these gaps - they act as magnets and entry zones.

FVG Formation: Bullish vs Bearish
Bullish FVG

3
Candle 3 low
Candle 1 high
GAP = FVG
Bearish FVG

GAP = FVG
The 7 FVG Rules
1. Align with Order Flow
Only use bullish FVGs in uptrends, bearish FVGs in downtrends. Never trade counter to the current order flow.
2. Never Use Mitigated FVGs
Once price touches an FVG (even barely), it's weakened. Only trade fresh, untouched gaps.
3. Target Discount/Premium Zones
For longs: target FVGs in the lower half (discount) of the move. For shorts: target FVGs in the upper half (premium).
4. Stack Timeframes
Find a 1H or 4H FVG, then drop to 15m or 5m to find a smaller FVG inside it. This gives precise entries with HTF confluence.
5. Check the 3rd Candle
If 3rd candle continues in direction = "breakaway gap" (strong). If 3rd candle reverses = "rejection gap" (weak, avoid).
6. FVGs at Runs are Strongest
If an FVG forms during or right after a liquidity run (breakout through a key level), it's highest probability.
7. Avoid Consolidation FVGs
If FVGs keep failing both ways, you're in chop. Wait for two consecutive FVGs to be respected before trading again.
Breakaway Gap vs Rejection Gap
Breakaway Gap (TRADE THIS)
3rd candle continues = STRONG
Rejection Gap (AVOID)
3rd candle reverses = WEAK
1.3 Order Blocks (OBs)
An Order Block is the last opposing candle(s) before an impulsive move. It represents where institutions placed their orders - and where they'll defend price if it returns.

Order Block Formation
Bullish Order Block
ORDER BLOCK
BOS level (highest wick)
BOS!
Bearish candles before bullish BOS
= Bullish Order Block
Bearish Order Block
ORDER BLOCK
BOS level (lowest wick)
BOS!
Bullish candles before bearish BOS
= Bearish Order Block
Order Block Rules
Must Be Validated by BOS
It's not an OB until price breaks the highest wick (bullish) or lowest wick (bearish). Before that, it's just candles.
Use Candle Bodies, Not Wicks
Mark from open of first candle to close of last candle in the OB sequence. The bodies define the zone.
Candles Must Be Sequential
No opposing colored candles in between. If a bullish candle interrupts bearish ones, the sequence is broken.
Only Use Unmitigated OBs
Once price touches an OB, it's "used up." The orders have been filled. Never trade the same OB twice.
50% Level is Strongest
The midpoint of the OB typically sees the strongest reactions. Consider this your optimal entry point within the OB.
Must Form From a PDA
High-probability OBs form after sweeps or FVG rejections. Random OBs without context are lower probability.
The Golden Zone: OB + FVG Overlap
When an Order Block has a Fair Value Gap overlapping it, you have the highest probability entry zone possible. This is where institutions have both unfilled orders AND an imbalance to fill. Prioritize these setups above all others.

Golden Zone: OB + FVG Confluence
OB
FVG
GOLDEN ZONE
OB + FVG overlap
= highest probability
1.4 Market Structure: BOS and CHoCH
Understanding structure tells you which direction to trade. Two key concepts determine trend state:

BOS
Break of Structure
Price breaks a swing high (bullish) or swing low (bearish), confirming trend continuation. This validates order blocks and tells you the trend is intact.

CHoCH
Change of Character
The first break against the current trend. Signals potential reversal. Not confirmation yet - just a warning that things may be changing.

The Reversal Sequence: Sweep → CHoCH → BOS → Entry
PDH / Swing High
1. SWEEP
CHoCH Level
2. CHoCH
(first lower low)
3. BOS
(confirms reversal)
4. ENTRY
(first FVG after BOS)
"Silver Bullet"
The Reversal Confirmation Sequence:
Sweep - Liquidity grabbed at key level (wick through, close back)
CHoCH - First break against trend (warning signal)
BOS - Price continues past CHoCH (trend officially reversed)
Entry - First FVG/OB after BOS (the "Silver Bullet")
Don't Jump the Gun: Many traders enter right after the sweep. That's gambling. Wait for CHoCH + BOS to confirm the reversal is real. The "Silver Bullet" FVG after BOS is your highest probability entry.
1.5 Runs vs Sweeps
When price attacks external liquidity (a key level), it does one of two things. Knowing which is happening determines whether you join or fade the move.

Outcome	What Happens	How to Identify	Your Trade
RUN	Price breaks through and continues	FVG forms DURING or AFTER breakout	JOIN the move on pullback to FVG
SWEEP	Price breaks through and reverses	No FVG at breakout, or wick rejection	FADE the move after CHoCH + BOS
Run vs Sweep Identification
LIQUIDITY RUN
(Continuation - JOIN it)
Key Level
FVG HERE!
Entry on
pullback
FVG at breakout = strength
Trade WITH the move
LIQUIDITY SWEEP
(Reversal - FADE it)
Key Level
SWEEP!
No FVG
at breakout
FVG after
Entry on
FVG retest
No FVG at breakout = weakness
Trade AGAINST the move
Pre-Trade Assessment: Before price hits a key level, note where the last FVG formed. If it's BELOW the level being attacked (for a move up), that's a sign the move lacks fuel - expect a sweep. If price creates a NEW FVG at/after the breakout, it's likely a run.
1.6 The Opening Range (OR)
The Opening Range is the high and low of the first candle after 9:30 AM open. Most traders use the 15-minute OR for the best balance of reliability and range size.

Opening Range Setup
9:30
9:45
10:00
10:15
OR High
OR Low
15-min
candle
Breakout!
OR Trading Scenarios
TRADE
Clean Breakout + FVG
Price closes above/below OR level. FVG forms at the breakout. Wait for pullback to FVG, then enter in breakout direction.

TRADE
False Breakout + Opposing FVG
Price wicks through OR level but closes back inside. Opposing FVG forms. Enter on retest of FVG to fade the failed breakout.

CAUTION
Breakout into HTF Level
OR breakout runs directly into PDH/PDL. High chance of reversal at that level. Either skip or take quick profits.

SKIP
Wide OR (>40 pts) or Chop
If OR is wider than 40 points or price is chopping inside with no clear direction, skip the session. No edge.

Critical OR Rule: Always check what's above/below the OR before trading the breakout. If the OR high is 5 points below PDH, a long breakout will immediately run into major resistance. The OR is a tool for timing entries - higher timeframe levels always take priority.
1.7 Higher Timeframe Bias
Before every session, check the 1-hour chart to determine which direction the market wants to go. This takes 60 seconds and dramatically improves your win rate.

1
Find the Last 1H Swing High and Low
Look at the past 2-3 days of 1H candles. Identify the most recent significant swing high and swing low.
2
Which One Did Price Break Most Recently?
If price broke the swing high → HTF bias is BULLISH. If price broke the swing low → HTF bias is BEARISH.
3
Locate 1H FVGs/OBs
Mark any unmitigated 1H FVGs or Order Blocks. These are zones where price is likely to react during your session.
How HTF Bias Affects Your Trades
HTF Bias	Sweep of Lows	Sweep of Highs
Bullish	A+ long setup (aligned with HTF)	Lower probability (fading HTF trend)
Bearish	Lower probability (fading HTF trend)	A+ short setup (aligned with HTF)
Counter-HTF Trades: You CAN still take trades against the HTF bias, but require more confirmation (full CHoCH + BOS sequence) and consider sizing down. The best trades are when your setup aligns with the 1H direction.
Part 2: The System
Now that you understand the concepts, here's how to execute them in a live session.

2.1 Pre-Session Checklist
Time: Before 9:30 AM
Duration: 2-5 minutes
Complete this checklist before every trading session. No exceptions.

1H Bias: Check 1H chart - is bias bullish or bearish? (Which swing broke last?)
Key Levels: Mark PDH, PDL, overnight high, overnight low on your chart
1H PDAs: Mark any unmitigated 1H FVGs or Order Blocks price may react to
Premium/Discount: Is current price in premium (above 50% of range) or discount (below)?
News Check: Any major economic releases today? (FOMC, CPI, NFP = be extra cautious or sit out)
2.2 The Trading Session
Time: 9:30 - 10:30 AM
Phase 1: Early Session (9:30 - 9:45)
Watch for immediate liquidity plays as the market opens.

Is price attacking a key level (PDH/PDL/overnight)?
YES ↓
NO ↓
Is it a RUN or SWEEP?
RUN
(FVG at breakout)
Join on pullback
SWEEP
(no FVG/rejection)
Fade after BOS
Wait for OR (9:45)
Phase 2: ORB Phase (9:45+)
Opening range established. Watch for breakout or false breakout.

Did price break OR high or low with a CLOSE (not just wick)?
YES (Clean breakout) ↓
NO (Failed/wick) ↓
Did FVG form at breakout?
YES
Enter pullback to FVG
NO
Weak - wait
Did opposing FVG form?
YES
Fade on FVG retest
NO
No setup - wait
2.3 Entry Criteria Checklist
Before entering ANY trade, confirm all of these:

HTF bias identified - You know if 1H is bullish or bearish
Trade aligns with HTF bias - Or has extra confirmation if counter-trend
Entry is at FVG or OB - You're entering at internal liquidity, not randomly
FVG/OB is unmitigated - It hasn't been touched before
Zone is in discount (longs) or premium (shorts) - Below/above 50% of the move
Clear target at external liquidity - You know where you're taking profit
Risk:Reward is at least 2:1 - Don't take trades with poor R:R
A+ Setup Qualifiers (Highest Probability)
These additional factors elevate a good setup to exceptional:

OB + FVG overlap ("Golden Zone")
Multi-timeframe confluence (1H FVG with 5m FVG inside)
Formed from a respected PDA (after sweep or FVG rejection)
Aligns perfectly with HTF bias
2.4 Entry, Stop, Target
ENTRY
Set limit order inside FVG/OB (typically at 50% of zone)
OR wait for price to enter zone and show rejection candle
For sweeps: enter on first FVG after BOS confirms ("Silver Bullet")
STOP LOSS
Beyond the FVG/OB (the invalidation point)
For sweeps: beyond the sweep wick
Typical range: 15-30 points on NQ
Never more than $400 risk per trade (MFF rules)
TARGET
Next external liquidity level (opposing PDH/PDL, swing high/low)
Or minimum 2:1 R:R
Consider: partials at 1:1, runner to full target
For MFF: aim for $400-600/day (consistency rule)

✓
OR range: 35 points (tradeable - under 40pt threshold)
✓
Breakout: 5m candle closes at 18,497 (above OR high)
✓
FVG forms: Bullish FVG 18,488-18,495, overlapping OR high
✓
HTF check: PDH is at 18,560 - plenty of room above

✓
Bearish FVG forms: 18,498-18,504 during the rejection
✓
HTF alignment: 1H bias is bearish - this is an A+ fade setup
✓
Entry: Price retests FVG at 18,500 (9:55 AM) - enter short

R:R
3.3:1
Example 5: Golden Zone Entry (OB + FVG)
After a sweep of PDH, bearish structure forms on the 5m chart. Order Block identified with overlapping FVG.
✓
Sweep: PDH swept at 9:36 AM, price reversing
✓
Structure shift: 5m shows CHoCH, then BOS to downside
✓
Order Block: Bearish OB forms at 18,485-18,478 (bullish candles before drop)
✓
FVG overlap: Bearish FVG 18,483-18,476 overlaps with OB
✓
Golden Zone: Overlap area is 18,483-18,478. OB 50% level is 18,481.
Entry
18,481 (short)
Stop
18,490 (-9 pts)
Target
18,420 (PDL)
R:R
6.8:1
Why this is A+: OB + FVG overlap (Golden Zone), formed from sweep (respected PDA), aligns with structure shift, excellent R:R.
Part 3: Quick Reference Cheat Sheet
Pre-Session (2 min before 9:30)

□ 1H Bias: Bullish / Bearish (which swing broke last?)
□ Key Levels Marked: PDH ___ PDL ___ ON-H ___ ON-L ___
□ 1H FVG/OB to watch: _______________
□ Premium or Discount?: _______________
Session Decision Tree

9:30-9:45: Price attacking key level?
├─ YES + SWEEP (wick rejection) → Fade after CHoCH + BOS + FVG
├─ YES + RUN (FVG at breakout)  → Join on pullback to FVG
└─ NO                          → Wait for OR (9:45)

9:45+: OR Breakout?
├─ Clean break + FVG at level   → Enter on pullback to FVG
├─ False break + opposing FVG   → Fade on retest of FVG
└─ No breakout / chop          → No trade today
Entry Checklist

□ Aligns with HTF bias?
□ Entry at FVG or OB?
□ Zone unmitigated?
□ In discount (long) / premium (short)?
□ Clear target at external liquidity?
□ R:R ≥ 2:1?
A+ Setup Qualifiers

★ OB + FVG overlap (golden zone)
★ Multi-TF confluence (1H + 5m)
★ Formed from respected PDA (sweep/FVG)
★ Perfect HTF alignment
Risk Management (MFF $50K)

Max position:     3 NQ or 30 MNQ
Suggested:        1-2 MNQ while learning
Stop loss:        15-30 points typical
Max risk/trade:   $200-400
Daily goal:       $400-600 (consistency rule: no day > 50% of total)
Walk away:        After 2 consecutive losses
Final Reminders:
No setup = No trade. Walking away is a valid and profitable outcome.
HTF trumps LTF. If your 5m setup conflicts with 1H bias, be extra cautious or skip.
Wait for confirmation. Don't enter on sweeps alone - wait for CHoCH + BOS.
FVGs/OBs are entries, not predictions. They tell you WHERE to enter, not IF price will get there.
Consistency > Home runs. $500/day for 6 days beats $3000 in one day (MFF rules).
