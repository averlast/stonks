Have you ever been in the position where you have found
what seems to be the perfect trade setup...
So you decide to jump into a trade,
and at first it seems to be going okay, but then all of a sudden
the market just completely crashes on you
and you're just left wondering what went wrong.
Well, in the majority of cases, the likely issue is
that you missed something important on a higher timeframe.
And this is the most common error that traders make when daytrading.
They only use 1 or 2 timeframes for their analysis,
which leads them into misunderstanding
the context of the larger market structure,
which is what actually dictates which moves the market intends to make.
So, to correct these mistakes, in this video,
we are going to cover what we call a top down analysis,
which will show you how to actually read a charts market structure
on a multi-timeframe basis,
which will make sure you don't miss any of the important details
that you might have previously overlooked,
as well as give you the strategies to find the best entries for your trades.
So let's waste no time and start with step number one,
which covers what top down analysis actually is
and how we use it in our trading strategies.
Within top down analysis,
the idea is that
you should actually be using all of these timeframes
when looking for potential trade setups.
And the way this works is by starting your chart analysis
on the monthly timeframe,
and then work your way down until you reach the timeframe
that you want to actually use for your entry setups.
But to understand why, we will split these
timeframes into three different categories,
with each of them being used for a different purpose.
The first category are the higher timeframes,
which consists of the monthly and weekly timeframes.
The role of this category
is to give us the context of the market, which involves
identifying the trends of the larger scale price action.
The second category are the medium timeframes,
which consists of the daily and four hour timeframes.
We use this category to look for potential trade setups
that align with the larger market structure.
And then for the third category, we have the lower timeframes,
which consists of the one hour and 15 minute timeframes.
And this category is used to actually enter our trades using the market analysis
from the larger timeframes.
But it's rare that you'll actually see a trader use all six of these timeframes.
And this is because the timeframes that a trader will use
will depend on their personal preference and trading strategies.
For example,
a position trader might prefer to use the monthly,
daily and one hour timeframes to target the larger market moves that play out
over a long period of time.
Whereas the timeframes that you typically see a day
trader use would be much lower because they are more focused
on taking trades that might span only a few hours.
But the point is,
it doesn't matter what type of trader you are. Top down
analysis will always be an important part of successfully reading a chart.
So let's now move on to the next step where we will show you
how we actually use top down analysis on a chart.
And to give an example of the specific criteria
we are looking for from each timeframe category.
So here we have a chart.
And for this example we are going to use the pathway
where we start on the weekly chart
before then using the four hour timeframe and finally the 15 minute timeframe.
But in the case that you don't personally use the timeframes
we are using within this example, it doesn't matter.
And this is because timeframes are fractal,
which means no matter what timeframes
you choose, the process of top down analysis is still the same.
And as a side note, we are going to use three timeframes in these examples.
But you can use as many as you think will help you find your edge,
but it should always be at least three.
So now going back to this example,
let's start our analysis on the weekly chart,
which as we mentioned in the last step is in the higher timeframe
category, which means what we are looking for
is the general directional bias of the market structure.
And this is important because the decision
of whether we should be looking for long or short trades on the lower
timeframes will be dependent on the directional bias
we can establish on this weekly timeframe.
So to find out which direction we should be looking to trade,
there are three steps we need to go through.
The first step involves breaking down the current market
structure to find the current order flow of the price action.
The second step involves identifying the key levels
that the market might look to target.
And then the third step involves figuring out which key
level is the current draw on liquidity
by using the context of the PD arrays within the chart structure.
So let's go through this process now
starting with the first step, the method for how we can find
the current order flow of the price action is very simple.
All we need to do is go through the previous moves of the chart,
and mark every break of structure and change of character that formed.
Because this will tell us which direction the market is currently trending.
And for this example, we can see that the market is currently bullish,
with the most recent move creating a bullish
break of structure, which suggests
we should be looking for long entries to align with the current uptrend.
But this only tells us what the market did
previously and not what it intends to do next.
So let's now move on to the second step,
which involves identifying potential targets.
And when we talk about targets, we are referring to any PD arrays
on the chart that the market might target to create its next move.
And these can be previous swing highs and lows.
The wicks of the previous candle.
Fair value gaps order blocks mitigation blocks or breaker blocks.
So with this in mind,
we now need to analyze this market structure
and look for any PD arrays that we can find.
So as a start
we can mark out the previous swing high and swing low levels
as these are the current external range liquidity levels of which one of them
will be the main target for the price action.
And if, for example,
the upper liquidity level is the level that ends up being broken through,
this would create a new bullish break of structure continuing the uptrend.
But on the other hand, if the lower liquidity level was the level
that ends up being broken through,
then we would see a bearish change of character form
that would signal that the uptrend has ended.
And as for the other PD arrays,
we have the high a low of the previous weekly candle.
And then we also have this bullish fair value gap too.
So this gives us all of the key information that we need to make
a judgment on the market's directional bias,
which moves us onto the next step,
which involves looking at the context of the current
PD arrays that we have identified to then form a theoretical narrative
for which direction the next move is most likely to take.
So the first PD arrays that we can analyze are the previous candles, high and low.
Because these are the most immediate targets.
But by looking at these levels without any other context,
there's no way to know which level will be attacked.
Because even if the market was planning on targeting the external range
high, it's possible that the market could first sweep the previous candles low
before then making the big move up.
And this is why it's important to make sure you take the time to identify
all of the PD arrays on the chart, because if you miss one,
you might miss an important piece of the puzzle.
And this is because when we mark out this fair value gap again,
if we look closely, we can actually see that
the fair value gap was mitigated during the previous candle,
which means that if the fair value gap has been respected
as an area of support,
it's likely that the low of this previous candle
is actually the low of this bearish move down.
Which means in terms of the previous candle's low,
it's highly probable that we won't see this level attacked.
And instead,
the support of the fair value gap has created the start of the next leg up.
So with this idea in mind, the narrative that we can lean towards
is that the next immediate PD array that will be targeted
is the previous candle's high.
And then from here, the move will push up to attack
the upper external range liquidity level.
So with this analysis we have established
a bullish directional bias, which tells us that
we should be looking for bullish setups to trade.
But remember
this is still only the weekly timeframe, which isn't the timeframe
that we want to use for actually entering our trades.
We have only analyzed this timeframe to understand the directional bias
and to identify the higher timeframe targets.
But on top of this, our bullish bias can only be validated
if we can prove that this weekly fair value gap is actually being respected.
So to find confirmation for this,
we need to move down into our next timeframe,
which in this example is the four hour timeframe.
And now going back to what we mentioned earlier on in the video,
we know that this four hour timeframe falls into the medium time
frame category, which means what we are looking for
within this timeframe is a suitable setup that we can use to enter a trade.
But more importantly, we also want to look for confirmation
that the bullish fair value gap that we found on the weekly time
frame is being respected,
because that is the confluence that we are using
to fuel our bullish trades on the lower timeframes.
And to do this, we can again go through the same simple process.
So the first step is to again analyze the current market structure,
to see whether this four hour price action has created a break of structure
or a change of character.
And as we can see in this example, the market created a liquidity
sweep before then pushing up to create a bullish change of character.
And this is very important if we are looking for a bullish setup,
because whilst we have a bearish move down on the weekly timeframe,
this doesn't tell us much about what the market is doing in real time
and where exactly it might create a reversal.
So by analyzing the market structure of the four hour chart,
we can see that the price action has now found support
and has transitioned from a bearish order flow and into a bullish order flow.
And what this means is that our four hour market
structure is now aligning with the bullish fair value gap
that we are targeting on the weekly timeframe.
But this still isn't where we want to enter a trade.
There is still more work to be done from here.
And so for the next step, we want to look within this
for our market structure for any bullish PD arrays that we can use for our trade
setup like this bullish fair value gap here.
But as we can see it has yet to be tested, which is actually good
because this allows us to prepare and use it as a target for our trade entry.
So to summarize what we have done so far, we have used the weekly chart
to understand the behavior of the larger market structure
by confirming that we are in a bullish trend
and that the price is currently sitting within a bullish weekly fair value gap.
And then on the four hour chart, we have confirmed that the price action
has created a bullish change of character, signaling
that the order flow has now switched from bearish to bullish,
which tells us that the market has respected
and found support within the weekly fair value gap.
And then from here, we have also found a four hour fair
value gap that we can target for actually entering a long trade.
So this means we have completed all the preparation
we need to finally move on to our final 15 minute
timeframe to actually execute our entry.
But remember, we are targeting the four hour fair value
gap for our setup, which means we need to wait for the price
to push down and into this area,
which after skipping ahead a little, it successfully does.
But again,
there is still further confirmation that we need in order to enter a trade.
And this is because even though we wanted the price
to move down into the four hour fair value gap,
the order flow of the 15 minute timeframe is still bearish.
So we must again go through the process
of analyzing the market structure one last time
by waiting for a bullish change of character,
as this will be the signal that the order flow of the 15 minute chart
is now aligned with both the four hour and weekly timeframes.
And once this has finally happened, all that is left is to find
a bullish PD array on the 15 minute timeframe to finally enter our trade.
But after all of this, you might still think that as a day
trader, all of this extra analysis on the larger
timeframes is unnecessary
if you only intend to use the lower timeframes to find your entries.
But you couldn't be more wrong.
And this is because when we are analyzing a chart
using different timeframes, the highest time
frames are always the most important because they determine
where the market actually intends to move.
Which also means that the PD arrays on
those higher timeframes will also be the strongest.
So whilst you should use the lower timeframes
like the 15 minute to enter a trade for greater accuracy,
if you are able to align the trade set up with the same directional
bias of the market structure on the higher timeframes, you can
then use the larger timeframe PD arrays
as optional exit targets, which can greatly increase
the potential risk to reward ratios of your trades.
And to give an example of this,
in the instance
that we have entered a trade using this 15 minute fair value gap,
you could set your stop loss somewhere under the FG,
because if the price was to break
lower than this area, the trade set up would be voided.
But then as for setting a take profit
target, you could of course just target the latest
15 minute swing high, which by all means is a nice trade.
But on the other hand, because we have gone through the process
of aligning our timeframes, we now have the option to aim
for higher targets like this previous high on the four hour chart.
And whilst it would mean that this trade might now
take a few more hours longer to complete in terms of risk to reward,
you'd have a much greater potential profit margin compared to a shorter term trade.
And to take it one step further
with the correct trade management, you could even aim for this weekly high
as a take profit target,
which again, would take longer to fulfill
but would result in a much higher profit return.
So the point is, by using top down analysis,
not only will you find far better entry positions,
but you will also have the support of the higher time
frame market structures, which in turn gives you the option
to aim for much more lucrative take profit targets.
But there are also other ways that we can use
top down analysis, which takes us on to the next step,
which involves looking into how we can use top down analysis on the lower time
frames to determine whether an attack on liquidity
is creating a liquidity run or a liquidity sweep.
So here we have another example of a chart.
And this time we are using the daily timeframe.
And the first thing you might have noticed is that this previous
liquidity level is currently being attacked.
But with only using the daily chart, we have no idea which way
the market will actually go,
because it has the possibility to either push up and create a liquidity run,
or it could push down, which would confirm the liquidity sweep.
But there is actually a way that we can determine what the market
is going to do before the move actually plays out on this daily chart.
And this involves understanding how timeframes truly work.
So when we do our analysis, we start with the highest timeframe
because it dictates which direction the market intends to go.
And then from here we work down looking for a set up,
an entry that aligns with the stronger market trends.
But on the other hand, let's say
all three of our timeframe categories were bullish.
And then we reach an area in the market where we suspect a reversal might occur.
In order for a true reversal to play out, we would need to confirm
that the market structure of the highest timeframe has turned bearish.
But in reality, in order for the highest time
frame to switch from bullish to bearish,
the first signal will always be found in the lowest timeframes.
And from there, if the bearish momentum is strong enough to cause a reversal,
that's when we would see a chain reaction reflected in the medium timeframes.
And then finally the larger timeframes,
which means in the case of our highest time
frame being the daily timeframe, we can actually use the one hour
and five minute timeframes to confirm a reversal was taking place before.
It has been made evident on the daily timeframe itself.
And to explain exactly what is meant by this,
we will show it using this attack on liquidity on the daily chart.
And so the first thing we want to do
is lay out the charts of our medium and lowest timeframes,
which in this case are the one hour and five minute timeframes.
And then from here we will again want to go through the process of top down
analysis to understand
the market structure of these timeframes, which will tell us
exactly what the market is doing within this daily candle.
So starting with the one hour chart,
if we look at the price action with the context of the daily
liquidity level, we can see exactly where in the day
the market pushed over it, as well as where it later pulled back under.
But this information alone doesn't give us the true context
of the market structure we are looking for.
Instead, we need to analyze the market's order flow to understand
which directional bias is currently being respected.
And we can do that by breaking the price action down piece by piece.
So earlier in the day,
we can see that the market created the daily low
before then creating a strong bullish move up, resulting in a bullish
break up structure which then peaked at the high of the day.
But after this, the market then pushed down and created a swing low,
which at the time could have just become a retracement for the next leg up.
But when the market did go on
to push back up instead of continuing higher,
it actually found resistance in this bearish FG,
which ended up pushing the price down and past the latest swing low,
which resulted in a bearish change of character.
So at this point, the market order
flow of the one hour timeframe has now switched to bearish.
And now all we have left is this bullish candle
which is currently attacking this bearish FG.
And because we have confirmed
that the order flow of this timeframe is now bearish,
we can presume that this fair value gap is being respected.
But the point of this video is to show that we don't have to just presume.
Instead, we can just continue our top down
analysis process by now, looking at the five minute chart
and by again going through the same process
of analyzing the price action, we can see exactly where the market
created a reversal in its order flow with this bearish change of character,
which then followed up by respecting this bearish
fair value gap before then creating the next bearish
move down, resulting in a new bearish break of structure.
So now after doing this quick analysis, we have now confirmed
that the order flow of the five minute chart is bearish
and in the process of this, we have also confirmed that the market
is currently respecting the hourly bearish fair value gap.
But when we refer back to the daily chart,
we can see that the market structure is technically still in a bullish order flow
because it is yet to create a bearish change of character.
And one of the rules of trading is to always trade
with the trend and not against it.
But when the market is attacked,
a PD array that has the potential to create a reversal
like the attack of this daily swing high in this example.
This is when we can justify the idea of shifting our directional bias,
but only once we have gone through the process
of top down analysis to confirm that the lower timeframes
are supporting the proposition of a reversal.
And this goes back to what we mentioned earlier, where
if we believe the higher timeframe is looking to switch its directional bias,
we would first see the switch occur on the lowest
timeframe first. Before then working its way up
till it finally plays out on the highest timeframe.
So thinking about the logic behind why we would be interested
in looking for short trades in this moment of time,
the idea that we are using is that the intention of the market
is to sweep this daily liquidity level,
in order to push down and attack this previous daily swing low,
which at that point would confirm the daily bearish change of character
and the justification we are using to support this idea,
is how the market structures of the one hour
and five minute timeframes of switched the bearish order flows,
and are now respecting bearish PD arrays that have formed.
And to see how this would play out,
the market first pushed down and broke past the five minute level,
which created a new bearish break of structure
on both a five minute and one hour timeframes.
And then from here it continues to push down,
targeting the one hour swing low, which also happens
to be the low of the previous daily candle.
And then finally it pushes down to attack the daily
swing well,
creating a bearish change of character,
which also confirms the order flow of the daily time
frame is now bearish, meaning the directional bias
of our three timeframes are now aligned once again.
So when it comes to top down analysis, we always start with our chart
analysis on the highest timeframes to identify
the larger PD arrays that the market is targeting.
And with this knowledge, we can then work our way down in time
frames to find a suitable setup for entering a trade,
so long as it aligns with our higher timeframe bias.
And then once we are in a trade, because we have gone through the process
of making sure our timeframes are aligned,
we can then manage it on the lowest timeframe, with the option to work
the trade into more lucrative targets on the higher timeframes.
But the emphasis should always be on making sure your timeframes are aligned.
And this means in the case of looking for long trades,
you want to make sure your timeframes are aligned on a bullish directional bias.
And as for short trades, you want your timeframes
to be aligned to a bearish directional bias.
But if you have gone through the process of top down analysis
and your timeframes are mismatched when it comes to the directional bias,
this is where you would want to avoid entering trades
because there is no definitive narrative
for which direction the market is looking to go.
