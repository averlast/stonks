When analyzing market structure,
we typically use the highs and lows on the chart to define the range.
But in candle range theory, the idea is that every individual candle
actually holds its own range.
And this makes sense,
because when we look at this daily candle on the one hour timeframe,
we can see that the daily candles wicks
represent the one hour swing low, and swing high.
Which in itself, forms its own isolated range.
And whilst this might seem like basic knowledge in market analysis,
when we incorporate smart money concepts,
this one candle setup can actually offer us consistent, high probability trades.
So in this video,
we've broken down everything that you need to know about Candle Range Theory,
into five simple steps.
So let's waste no time and start with step number one,
which is how we can use Candle Range Theory to identify trade setups.
The typical framework for this strategy, usually involves three candles,
and each candle has its own important role.
So let's start with the first candle.
Here we have a bullish candle on the daily timeframe,
and we can visualize this candle’s price data, with higher and higher accuracy,
the lower down we go in timeframes.
But for this strategy,
all of the price action data we need from all of these candles,
can still be found in the daily candle.
And this comes down to the basic information that it tells us...
which is that during this specific day,
the market opened at this price,
and ended up closing at this price.
With the highest and lowest prices found in the wicks.
Now, when it comes to Candle Range Theory,
the belief is that both the top and bottom wicks, act as their own isolated Liquidity levels,
that the following candles will use as targets.
And this makes sense,
because if you take a look at any random chart,
you'll see that almost every individual candle will have attacked
either the previous candle’s high, or its low.
So in terms of Candle Range Theory,
the first candle is simply used to define a range that we are interested in trading.
And the upper Liquidity level is called the Candle Range High (CRH),
and the lower Liquidity level is called the Candle Range Low (CRL).
And if you're wondering which candle can be used to define a tradable range,
we can actually use any candle that you might find on a chart...
And this can also be on any timeframe...
But there is of course criteria that helps us define what makes a candle ideal to use.
Which we will be covering later into the video.
And then for the second candle...
This plays the most important part in whether we actually have a setup, or not.
And the reason being, is that the whole concept behind Candle Range Theory...
is that if the price attacks the Candle Range High (CRH), but fails to close above it,
there's a high probability that the next target will become the Candle Range Low (CRL).
So to walk through what this looks like,
we want to see the second candle push up and above the Candle Range High (CRH) of the first candle,
before then pulling back into the range, where it will then close.
And it's crucial that we see this Liquidity Sweep occur,
because if we were to instead see this second candle close above the Candle Range High (CRH),
the potential Candle Range Theory setup is no longer valid,
as it's more likely that the market will continue pushing up...
instead of targeting our first Candle’s Range Low (CRL).
So if the criteria is met for the second candle,
we can then look within the third candle for a setup that,
that we can use to take a short entry,
with our target being the Candle Range Low (CRL).
You can of course hold your trade for longer...
if the external market structure validates it.
but once the price has passed the Candle Range Low (CRL),
we consider the setup complete.
So we have now broken down Candle Range Theory as a concept...
but we haven't shown how we can actually use it to enter trades.
So let's now go down in timeframes,
to give an example of how we might navigate our way through this setup.
So here we have the price action of the first daily candle,
with the buy-side and sell-side Liquidity levels...
that were created at the high and low of the day.
And when we move on to the second daily candle,
the first thing to take note of, is the sweep on the buy-side Liquidity.
Before the price then falls back down into the range.
This is important...
because when we see that the buy-side Liquidity of a candle has been swept,
it typically signals that the price is going to target the sell-side Liquidity next.
So the Liquidity Sweep is the first phase of the setup.
And the next piece of chart structure we are looking for,
is a change of character from the price pushing below the bullish leg that created the sweep...
because this signals strength in bearish momentum,
which is what we want, if we are looking to take a short.
And then for the final piece of criteria,
we want to see that a bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG) has been formed,
during this bearish leg that created the change of character...
because this is the PD array that we will actually use for our entry.
So to summarize this so far,
the first daily candle is used to define the range we are looking to trade.
And then we analyze the second candle,
to see whether its market structure fits the criteria we are looking for.
And this brings us onto the third daily candle....
which is where we can actually look to place our entry,
which simply involves shorting this bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG),
with the target being the Candle Range Low (CRL).
Now, it's also worth mentioning that a lot of traders that use this system,
choose to enter trades on the break of the second candle's low,
but as we know, breakout trading is far riskier than using
Internal Range Liquidity (IRL) as an entry target.
And on top of this, if we think the move is going to go lower,
the Fair Value Gap (VFG) offers us a much better entry price anyway.
And then with the price hitting the first daily Candle’s Range Low (CRL),
this completes the three candle setup.
We then also have the bullish variant, which involves the same fundamentals.
Except, we are looking for manipulation on a bearish candle’s Range Low (CRL),
with the target being it’s range high.
So now that we've covered the basics of Candle Range Theory,
let's move on to the second step:
which is that a setup using Candle Range Theory, doesn't have to involve only three candles.
We started off with this setup,
because it's the simplest example for explaining this concept.
But in reality, there isn’t actually a rule
for how many candles it might take for a setup to complete.
This is because it doesn't matter how many candles a CRT setup involves,
the important criteria is that the market structure displays a clear AMD formation.
And as a simple explanation for AMD...
it stands for: Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution.
which are the three phases of the Smart Money Concepts (SMC) model
we call the ‘Power of Three’.
And it's in the Distribution Phase where we would be looking for our trade entry,
but only after we have seen the confirmation of the first two phases.
Now, when we look at this chart...
we can see a clear example of the AMD structure that we are looking for.
We of course have the first candle,
that we are using for the Candle Range High (CRH) and Low (CRL).
And then after this, we have these three candles,
that we can see haven't moved the price much in either direction.
This is the Accumulation Phase.
But then we have this next candle which creates a sweep on Liquidity...
And this is the Manipulation Phase we are wanting to see.
But remember, it's important that this candle closes back within the range.
Otherwise, the potential setup for a short trade would be void.
And then following this, we have these two bearish candles,
which go on to attack the candle range low.
This is the Distribution Phase that completes the setup.
And it's where we would be looking to find an entry...
after the Manipulation Phase has been confirmed.
So the takeaway here, is that the important part of this strategy,
is finding the correct market structure, in the form of an AMD model.
And with this understanding, we can even find setups that involve only two candles.
But to explain how this works,
we would have to look at this second candle on a lower timeframe.
And here we can again see that we have another AMD model.
With an Accumulation Phase,
followed by Manipulation in the form of a Liquidity Sweep.
Before price then pushes down during the Distribution Phase.
And in terms of market structure analysis,
we can see where the price creates a Change of Character (CHoCH) after the Liquidity Sweep.
Before then using the bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG) as a catalyst,
to attack the Candle Range Low (CRL).
So, the point is that time is relative...
so there is no specific amount of candles,
that you can expect to a CRT model to complete within.
The important part is making sure that the correct market structure is present.
So, let's now move on to step number three:
which is how you should pair timeframes to find entries with CRT.
So now that we understand the concepts behind candle range theory,
it's important to emphasize how we should actually plan our setups using this strategy.
For example, here we have a chart on the daily timeframe.
And as we can see, the price has attacked this buy-side Liquidity level.
And with our knowledge on Smart Money Concepts (SMC),
we know that this is a pivotal moment in deciding whether
the price will continue to push up, or push down.
in the form of a Liquidity Run, or a Liquidity Sweep.
Which makes this an ideal scenario, for using CRT to analyze this candle,
to figure out what exactly the market is going to do.
And now, with the Candle Range High (CRH), and Low (CRL) drawn out...
we know that if the following candle sweeps the range high (CRH),
it's likely that it will then target the Range Low (CRL) next.
But observing this on the daily timeframe doesn't really tell us much,
because whilst it will show where this second candle will open and close,
it doesn't offer us the important market structure that we are looking for,
in order to justify a trade.
This is why it's important to understand
that we only use the higher timeframe to define the Candle’s Range High and Low,
and then we move down to a lower timeframe,
which allows us to actually break down the market structure,
to see whether there is a tradable setup.
And we call this timeframe alignment.
And we use it for every type of setup using Smart Money Concepts (SMC).
For those unaware, here are the timeframe pairings that are the best to use.
So as an example, if you were analyzing a monthly candle using CRT,
you would then look within the daily timeframe,
to look for the ideal market structure, that could provid a potential trade setup.
And then as another example,
if you were analyzing a candle on the four hour timeframe,
you would want to look for entries
within the structure on the 15 minute timeframe.
So now moving on, we have step number four:
Which is that when looking for entries,
you should be targeting the ideal Premium and Discount areas.
As we have already covered,
we know that a single candle represents its own isolated range
on the lower timeframes.
And this means we should be trading a CRT range
the same way we would with any other range.
So in the case that we are using a bullish candle for defining our range,
we would of course be looking for a setup to take a short trade...
And this means, we would want to be looking for opportunities
to enter a trade within the Premium Area.
And the Premium Area is anywhere above the 50% mid-level of the range,
and then anywhere below the mid-level, is what we call the Discount Area.
So with this in mind, when we move forward in time
to see the next two daily candles broken down on this timeframe,
this Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a great area to enter a short,
because it follows all of the criteria we are looking for in terms of market structure,
whilst also being within the Premium Area of the range.
And on the other hand, if we are using a bearish candle for our CRT range,
we would be looking for a long entry,
which means we would be wanting to look for bullish setups within the Discount Area,
which is anywhere under the mid level of the range.
This will make sure you are getting the best risk-to-reward for your trades.
So now let's move on to step five:
which covers when we should and shouldn't use CRT.
The concepts behind Candle Range Theory (CRT) are very powerful,
but only when used under the right circumstances.
For example, here we have a bullish candle,
which is then followed by a candle that has created a Liquidity Sweep
on the Candle Range High (CRH).
And with only this information,
we might expect the third candle to push down and attack the Candle Range Low (CRL).
But whilst this setup might look promising at first,
the crucial part that most traders overlook
is making sure that the setup actually makes sense,
within the context of the external market structure.
So now that we can see the full range from which these candles were taken from,
when we analyze further into the chart,
we can actually speculate that this CRT setup is highly likely to fail...
because in order for the price to push down and past the Candle Range Low,
it would need to overpower this bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG)...
that also happens to be overlapping with a bullish Orderblock (OB).
So now that we have done some further analysis,
our bias should actually lean more towards being bullish,
which opposes the idea behind this CRT setup.
And then when we move forward in time,
as expected, the setup does end up failing...
due to the strength of the buying power found in the bullish PD arrays.
And now moving on here,
here we have another potential candle that we can use for a CRT setup.
But this time, the setup actually has great potential
because it has occurred at an important point of interest,
which is this attack on Liquidity.
And the way we should think about Candle Range Theory (CRT)
is that it is essentially a method to signal a reversal of the price’s direction.
Which makes it a great tool to use during an attack of Liquidity,
because it can help us analyze whether we are seeing a Liquidity Run
or a Liquidity Sweep, within the moment that it is playing out.
But keep in mind,
we would also have to assess the lower timeframe’s market structure
to really have an understanding of what the market is wanting to do.
And this is because we should never take a trade using the higher timeframe,
without understanding how the market structure is forming within the lower timeframes.
Another great way to use CRT
is when the price is drawing into a PD array,
such as this bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG) here.
The reason being is that after the Change of Character (CHoCH),
we should already be under the belief
that the price is likely to reverse from this zone.
So we can use Candle Range Theory (CRT)
to find the confirmation on whether this Fair Value Gap (FVG) is being respected.
The takeaway is the Candle Range Theory can be a very useful tool
within your trading analysis, to identify and trade reversals in the market.
But, it's also just as important to understand when you should actually use it.
