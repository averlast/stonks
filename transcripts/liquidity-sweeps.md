The video is titled "Liquidity Sweep Trading Strategy Explained" from the channel Trader Tips. there are two challenges that Traders typically face with liquidity the first is knowing which level is actually being targeted and the second is knowing whether the price is going to make a continuation or a reversal which involves an understanding in advanced Market structure which most Traders lack so in this video we've broken down everything you need to know about trading liquidity into five simple steps so let's waste no time and start with step number one which is understanding the different forms of liquidity liquidity refers to areas in the chart that either contain a large large quantity of unfilled orders or a large quantity of stop losses and it presents itself in two different forms when people typically talk about liquidity they are usually referring to the external range liquidity which can be either a previous swing high or a previous swing low these are pivotal moments in the chart because they either result in a trend continuation or a trend reversal in the form of liquidity runs and liquidity sweeps which we will be covering further into the video the other form of liquidity is internal range liquidity which is just another for fair value gaps this is what the price uses as fuel to attack the swing highs and lows it's important that you pay attention to how the price interacts with both forms of liquidity because together they will tell you which direction the market is going to move for our next step we need to talk about order flow and how it can help us determine which liquidity level we should be targeting when we look at a chart the first thing we should do is look to see whether the current order flow is bullish or bearish and this depends on whether the price is pushing through buy side or sells side liquidity which can can seem confusing at a glance but we can simplify this through the use of two concepts which are called Break of structure and change of character so let's see how they work when a new swing forms on the chart liquidity levels are created at the swing high and swing low the liquidity level at the high is called the buy side liquidity and the liquidity level at the low is called the sell-side liquidity for the context of break of structure and change of character we look at which type of liquidity was ran through when this new swing was created which in this case was a buy side liquidity which means we are currently in a bullish order flow so with this in mind our current break of structure level is the buy side liquidity this is because a break of structure refers to the level that would need to be broken through in order for the current market Trend to continue which in this case is an uptrend and on the other hand the current change of character level would be the cells side liquidity and this is because if this lower level was to be hit it signals to us that the order flow might be looking to change which in this case would be from a bullish order flow to a bearish order flow but in this instance the price pushes up and through the buy side liquidity which creates the break of structure confirming that the uptrend is continuing and now with this new bullish swing we have a new set of break of structure and change of character levels that we can use to assess if this uptrend will continue to progress here we have another depiction of a price swing but this time when we look at the liquidity that was broken before this swing was created we can see it was a sell side liquidity which means that this chart would currently be in a bearish order flow and this means that the current break of structure would instead be the sell-side liquidity level because this would be the target level if sellers wish to continue the downtrend and on the other side the change of character level would be the buy side liquidity because this would signal a change in order flow from bearish to bullish but for this example the price chooses to push down and through the sells side liquidity confirming the break of structure which tells us the current downtrend is continuing so in summary a break of structure refers to when a liquidity level is run that confirms the continuation of the current Trend and what one of the most important rules in trading is that we should always trade the direction of the Market's order flow and not against it but this leaves the question how do we know when the order flow has reversed well here we have another uptrend validated by the break of structure let's say price has hit resistance here but this time instead of creating a higher low we instead see price push down to form a lower low this is what we call a change of character because it is the first signal that the price action may be changing from bullish to bearish when this occurs this lower low becomes the new break of structure and the previous swing high now becomes the change of character level this is because this high is now the level that would have to break in order to signal that we could be returning back to bullish order flow but as it stands we shouldn't flip our bias to bearish just yet and the reason being is that this change of character could really just be a liquidity sweep instead we want to wait to see if the price will push down and pass the break of structure level as this will confirm the start of a downtrend so in summary a break of structure confirms a trend continuation and a change of character signals that the direction of the order flow could be reversing we'll now develop what we've covered so far in our next step which is understanding the relationship between external and internal range liquidity here we have an uptrend and we know this because the price has created a break of structure by pushing through the previous swing high and with this new bullish swing that was created we have our current external range liquidity levels but because we know this structure is currently in an uptrend we should be expecting the price to Target the upper buy side liquidity level but in order to do this it needs to find some kind of support that can create the next bullish leg and this is where we look within the previous swing for bullish internal range liquidity in the form of a bullish fair value Gap and this is what the market can use as fuel to go and push through the buy side external range liquidity so what we've just seen happen is the market has used internal range liquidity to push through the external range liquidity level and this has now given us a new swing with its own external range liquidity levels and if we are expecting the price to continue this up Trend we should again look within this new swing to find a bullish fair value Gap that can be used as fuel to create the next leg up so to summarize this during an uptrend we expect to see the impulsive moves leave behind internal range liquidity in the form of bullish fair value gaps that can then be used in the future to push through the buy side external range liquidity to create new higher highs and for downtrends it's the same but just in Reverse if we are expecting price to break through the cell-side external range liquidity levels we want to look with within the previous impulsive bearish move for internal range liquidity that can progress the move lower in the form of a bearish fair value Gap so this explains the relationship between internal and external range liquidity which is how the trending moves are formed on the chart and it's important to always keep this in mind when doing your technical analysis because when we see the internal range liquidity get disrespected it's the first sign that the market is wanting to attack the change of character level which could result in a full reversal so now it's time for the next step which involves understanding the difference between liquidity runs and liquidity sweeps and more importantly how we can predict which of the two is going to happen when the price attacks an external range liquidity level which is either a previous swing high or a previous swing low it can do one of two things the first option is for it to continue in the same direction which is what we call a liquidity run and the second option is to create a reversal which is what we call a liquidity sweep this might seem simple at a first glance but understanding what price is going to do at a liquidity level is where most Traders struggle so let's start by looking at liquidity runs first here we have a swing High which is the current external range liquidity that we are drawing into price then pushes up and closes above the level but as it stands this isn't yet a liquidity run it has only created a breakout what we looking for is an additional bullish candle to form that creates a bullish fair value Gap that overlaps with the breakout of the external range liquidity this is because in order for the bullish move to continue it needs to create internal range liquidity which it can use use as support during the next retracement on the other hand if it were to create the fair value Gap above the level this is also valid the important part is that the internal range liquidity is created during or after the breakout because this shows strength for the buyers by creating an area that they can use as support for the next leg up however if the fair value Gap was created before the breakout we cannot use it for validation of a run on liquidity we have to wait and see if the chart creates the correct internal range liquidity that favors a trend continuation as for liquidity runs on the cell side we use the exact same principles just upside down this means we are looking for the creation of a fair value Gap either within the breakout of the liquidity level or underneath it we don't want to consider the fair value gaps that formed above the level so let's now talk about liquidity sweeps here we have another swing high as our draw on liquidity but this time when price attacks the level it fails to push over and close above it this shows massive weakness in the buyer efforts creating what many know as a fake out which is the clearest signal we could get that the price is creating a liquidity sweep from here we expect to see a reversal in order flow meaning we should now be looking for short entries but in the instance that this bullish candle does close over the liquidity level it doesn't mean a liquidity sweep is off the table and this is because if we look at where the last bullish fair value Gap was created we can see that it's below the external range liquidity so if price was to move down from here there's a high chance that this fair value Gap will be completely disrespected which is the first signal that the order flow could be switching but with that said we don't want to consider shorting just yet using the knowledge on Market structure that we covered earlier in the video we want to see if the price will push down below this previous swing low because this would create a change of character which is the second signal for the change of order flow but the final piece that we are looking for is whether this bearish leg down managed to create a bearish fair value Gap because this is what sellers can use as resistance to continue the downward move creating a new break of structure which confirms that the market has now transitioned into a bearish order flow this is the typical setup that we tend to see when the market creates a liquidity sweep and the important note to take here is that we shouldn't actually be taking trades solely on how the price reacts to the external range liquidity instead we should be looking at how the market structure forms and then look for entries when it has shown a clear directional bias which moves us on to the next step which is that we should be using top- down analysis when looking for our trade setups we'll demonstrate this by analyzing this segment of a chart on the 4-Hour time frame so firstly we want to know which direction the current order flow is moving in which we can see is bullish because we have this break of structure through the previous buy side liquidity so this means we should be looking to buy from somewhere within this range but where exactly should we be looking for our trade entry well going back to what we covered earlier about the relationship between external and internal range liquidity we should be looking for a fair value Gap within this leg that we can use for our long trade but even with this we shouldn't just blindly take a trade if the price draws into it what we should instead do is move down down into a smaller time frame to analyze whether the market actually respects this 4H Our Fair Value Gap so here we are looking at the same chart but now on the 15-minute time frame and as expected we can see the current order flow on this time frame is bearish which we can confirm with this break of structure but remember we want to enter a long trade so what we are looking for is a reversal on this 15-minute time frame so it aligns with the bullish 4-Hour order flow and when we Mark out the current external range levels we see a sweep occur which as we know is the first phase of the reversal we are looking for we then see the bearish fair value Gap get disrespected followed by a change of character which means all we are waiting for now is the bullish break of structure to Signal the reversal is complete which it doesn't take long to do when a reversal like this occurs the first fair value Gap to form afterwards is what is commonly known as the Silver Bullet this is because it is the highest probability fair value Gap that the market can offer so this is what we will use to enter our long trade and now we can switch back to the 4our time frame with the confidence that this 4-Hour fair value Gap has been respected based on the confirmation of the 15-minute Trend reversal and from here we want to see the price push up to the buy side liquidity where we can exit our trade we could of course hold this trade for a longer period if we believe the market will continue in the bullish Direction but if we were to do this we need to move up to a larger time frame so we can analyze the larger market structure and now here on the weekly time frame we can see that the market is actually making very bearish swings which means whilst our short term trade made sense on the 4-Hour time frame the price has actually moved into a weekly bearish fair value Gap so we should be expecting a reversal on the lower time frames to align with the weekly Market structure the key takeaway here is that we should always analyze what the market is doing on the largest time frames first because this will give us an idea of how we can expect the price to behave when it hits an area of liquidity on the lower time frames if you found this video helpful please leave a like and then comment what trading concept you'd like to see us cover next
