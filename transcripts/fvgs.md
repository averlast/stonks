[00:00] fair value gaps are a great tool to include into your trading strategy but if you are interested in using [00:05] them you need to understand what actually makes a valid fair value Gap that's usable so we've broken down everything [00:11] you need to master FEG trading into seven easy to follow tips but first we need to know how they [00:16] work here we have a series of three bullish candles and within their formation lies a bullish fair value Gap [00:22] the Gap forms when there is a space left between the first candle's top Wick and the third candle's bottom [00:27] Wick which is also known as a bullish imbalance to give a simple explanation behind why imbalances are important the [00:34] chart likes Balan price action and to achieve this it needs to see both buyers and sellers taking part in [00:39] the moves so when we have a move that involves only buyers taking part this creates a bullish imbalance and [00:45] the same happens when only sellers are taking part it creates a bearish imbalance so with this logic this area [00:51] is a bullish imbalance because it was a strong impulsive move for buyers meaning in the future we can expect [00:57] it to act as a magnet for price to draw into before continuing the upward move and in doing so [01:03] this area has now been rebalanced we then also have the bearish variation which follows the same principles the only [01:08] difference is that the imbalance is to the downside meaning we expect price to push into it from below in [01:14] order to rebalance the area before then continuing the next leg down if there is no gap between the first [01:19] and third candles Wix like in this formation on the right it means the price action is already balanced meaning [01:25] there is no fair value Gap to trade so now that we've covered what fair value gaps are let's start [01:30] off with our first tip which is that you should only be using fgs that align with the current order [01:34] flow price can only go in two directions but it rarely ever moves in one straight line instead it makes [01:40] many smaller moves which together create the larger swings in the case of an uptrend we know that in order [01:46] for it to remain valid we need to see it create new higher Highs but after a high is created [01:51] we know a retracement is expected and when the price comes down it needs to find some kind of support [01:56] that it can use to create the next leg up and this is where we would look with in the [02:00] previous leg to find a bullish fair value Gap that can provide the liquidity needed to continue the upward move [02:05] we can see a good example within this chart here every time we see a higher high form we then [02:10] see a retracement back into a bullish fair value Gap where it finds the support needed to continue the upward [02:15] move as for downtrends we know that in order for the price to continue creating new lower lows it needs [02:21] to find a form of resistance to create the next leg down and this is when we would use a [02:25] bearish fair value Gap we can see an example of this here within this downtrend tring structure every time a [02:31] new lower low formed it then retraced back up and into a bearish fair value Gap where it then saw [02:36] resistance before continuing the move down so to sum this up during an uptrend we only use the bullish fair [02:42] value gaps that form and during a downtrend we only use the bearish fair value gaps this makes sure we [02:48] are correctly following the order flow of the chart now moving on the next tip is that you should never [02:53] use an FEG that has already been touched for example here we have a fair value Gap but if we [02:59] look closely we can see that the price has already dipped into it even though it barely entered the fvg [03:04] we still consider it mitigated meaning it has become greatly weakened and if we are looking for the highest quality [03:09] fair value gaps we may no longer want to consider using this one but with that said it doesn't mean [03:14] this F will definitely fail if the price moves back into it for a second time it's just a warning [03:19] that fegs that have already been touched should be considered weaker than those that haven't been for our next tip [03:25] you should be targeting fair value gaps that are created within a discounted area to give an example of this [03:31] here we have a strong bullish move but when we Mark out the fair value gaps we have a few [03:35] to choose from so the question is which ones should we be targeting for our trades well the first thing [03:40] we should do is Mark out the top and bottom of the move along with the 50% midlevel this will [03:45] give us what we call the premium and discount areas of the range to put it into simple terms if [03:51] we are looking for a long trade setups found within the discount area will always be the strongest so when [03:56] we now look back at the chart these highlighted fair value gaps are the we should be targeting for our [04:01] long trades and we can do the same for bearish fegs within a downtrend the only difference is we want [04:06] to be targeting the fair value gaps that were created in the premium area which is anywhere above the 50% [04:12] line now we are moving on to some of the more advanced aspects starting with our next tip which is [04:17] that you should look to combine fbgs on different time frames for a more precise entry most Traders using fbgs [04:23] choose to take trades from either the top the bottom or the middle of the Gap and while this isn't [04:28] a wrong way to trade there is a better way to find a more precise entry let's say for this [04:33] example we found this FEG on the 4-Hour time frame which is giving us quite a large range that the [04:38] price could potentially reverse from so instead of taking a trade with such a wide margin of error we can [04:44] instead move down in time frames to find a more confined area here we are now looking at the price [04:49] action on the 15-minute chart that created the larger 4H hour FEG and when we look closely we can see [04:55] that there was a 15-minute fair value Gap that formed during this upward move this should be our new Target [05:00] for a long entry because it has the Confluence of a 15-minute fair value Gap within a 4-Hour fair value [05:06] Gap creating a very strong area of support the next tip we have is that you should consider the third [05:11] candle of an FEG the most important here we have two impulsive bullish candles and just by observing these two [05:17] candles we already know the maximum potential size of the F before the third candle has even opened but we [05:23] aren't really interested in the size of the Gap what we are really looking at is the way in which [05:28] the third candle chooses to form for example if we were to see the creation of a bearish candle like [05:33] this it creates what we call a rejection fair value gap which we should avoid taking trades from and the [05:38] reason behind this lies with how the third candle that formed the F showed a large amount of strength for [05:44] sellers which means whilst this Gap May initially see a bullish rejection there's a high chance that it will quickly [05:49] fail but on the other hand if the third candle that created the FEG was an additional bullish impulsive candle [05:55] this is what we call a breakaway Gap and these are the fegs that we want to trade this is [06:00] because it has shown an impressive strength for buyers Breakaway gaps typically take longer to be drawn into but they [06:06] provide a much greater chance of providing a strong support for the next leg up for tip number six you [06:11] need to understand how to trade fegs that form around a liquidity area because they can offer the strongest fair [06:17] value gaps possible price is only ever doing one thing and that is targeting external range liquidity which is either [06:23] a previous swing high or a swing low and to get there it uses internal range liquidity as fuel or [06:29] in other words an F but depending on how the liquidity is taken price can do one of two things [06:35] in this first chart we have a clear swing high that is our current draw on liquidity and we then [06:40] see a very impulsive bullish move that blasts straight through the level this is what we call a liquidity run [06:46] which is when the price has completely disrespected the previous swing High which confirms that we are continuing the bullish [06:51] Trend and as for fair value gaps we want to see a bullish FEG form within the move that broke [06:56] through the liquidity level as this will create the strong EST type of FEG we can find because it has [07:02] the Confluence with the liquidity run which makes it a very high probability area of support then we have another [07:08] scenario where we again have a swing high as our draw on liquidity but this time instead of the price [07:13] bursting through the level we actually see the candle fail to close above the line this is what we call [07:18] a liquidity sweep which is when the buyers aren't strong enough to continue the move up as for the FG [07:23] that formed here we shouldn't consider using it for a long trade and the reason being is due to the [07:28] price failing to push over the liquidity level as this signals that we are likely now flipping the directional bias [07:34] from bullish to bearish meaning we should now be looking to take trades within bearish fgs to continue the move [07:39] down which follows the rule we made in the first step which is that we should always follow the order [07:44] flow of the chart and for our next step you're going to want to avoid trading fgs during consolidation periods [07:50] the easiest way to make money in the markets is to trade during a trending phase because all it takes [07:55] is a confirmation of a trend continuation and going Beyond this most Traders will be able to successfully identify a [08:02] trend reversal using simple knowledge of Market structure but then when it comes to a consolidation area they end up [08:08] repeatedly getting chopped up not knowing which direction they should be targeting this is because when we are looking for [08:12] a bias in Trend we want to first see an F get respected and from the move that then transpires [08:18] we want to see the creation of an additional F that can be used to further Propel the price up [08:23] but then when we eventually see a bullish FEG fail people immediately flip towards a bearish bias but if the [08:29] next bearish FEG that formed happens to fail too this is when your instincts should tell you that there's a [08:34] good chance we are entering a consolidation area but if you're only interested in trending phases you're going to wait [08:39] to see when price next creates and respects two new FS as this will give you new short-term directional bias
