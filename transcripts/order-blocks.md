[00:00] a solid order block trading strategy is often the missing piece for most traders that use Smart money Concepts and [00:05] this is because they don't understand the important criteria that actually creates a high probability order block but in this [00:11] video we've explained and simplified everything that you need to know so you never have to struggle with order blocks [00:17] again and to do this we've broken down the perfect order block trading strategy into six simple steps so let's [00:24] start with step number one which involves answering the question what are order blocks here we have an example of [00:30] a chart and the first thing we can immediately notice is that the market is moving within an uptrending structure [00:35] but when we look at this second leg you might be wondering why it chose to push up from this [00:39] specific area well when we look over to the left side of the chart we actually have a bullish order [00:44] block and this is what was used as an area of support for the price to continue higher and the [00:48] reason for this is because this is an area in the market which showed a clear history of seller activity [00:54] which is made obvious by the large amount of executed sell orders represented by the bearish candles so this makes [01:00] it an area that smart money will Target to fill their large buy orders due to the lack of seller [01:05] activity in the rest of the leg so to simplify this bullish order blocks consist of bearish candles and they [01:11] act as a form of support with the purpose to push the price higher and then we also have the [01:15] other variation which are the bearish order blocks which is instead made up of bullish candles and these are used [01:21] in the same way only upside down meaning they instead act as a form of resistance on the chart but [01:26] this is only the very Basics because where most Traders go wrong is failing to actually understand the further Market [01:32] structure that needs to be present in order to correctly validate an order block but we have a few pieces [01:37] of criteria that makes this very simple the first thing to understand is that there isn't a specific number of [01:43] candles that can make up an order block so to give an example for this here on the left we [01:47] have an order block that is made up of four candles and then on the right side we have another [01:52] order block that consists of just one single candle both of these are valid order blocks and this is because [01:57] it doesn't matter how long it takes for an order block to be created the only variable that changes from [02:02] the different number of candles between these two bullish order blocks is the time that the sellers were in control [02:07] for the next thing we need to cover is something you might have already noticed which is that when we [02:11] Mark out our order blocks we choose to use the candle bodies instead of the Wicks so using this four [02:17] candle order block as an example the order block spans from the first candle's opening price to the last candle's [02:22] closing price and the same rule applies if it was just a single candle order block but it would just [02:27] be from the opening price to the closing price of just one candle and then for the bearish order blocks [02:32] we use the same parameters but because a bearish order block consists of bullish candles the opening price of the [02:38] first candle would be at the bottom while the closing price of the last candle would be at the top [02:43] so now that we know how we Mark out an order block let's move on to the next step which [02:47] involves how we can confirm whether an order block is valid so using this chart from before we know that [02:52] this formation of bearish candles formed a bullish order block that went on to be respected when the price later [02:57] Drew into it but let's say we were at the point in time when these bearish candles had just formed [03:02] the question we have to ask is whether these bearish candles have currently created a bullish order block and the [03:08] answer would be no and the reason why is because we haven't seen what the price is going to do [03:12] next for example the price could have just ended up moving sideways which would mean those bearish candles never ended [03:18] up forming an order block this is because in terms of the criteria needed for these candles to become a [03:23] bullish order block we need to see an impulsive bullish move that pushes through the highest top Wick of the [03:29] bearish candles which in this case is the first candle and it's only after we see this break of structure [03:34] that we can confirm that these bearish candles have created a valid bullish order block so to give another example [03:40] for this here we have four bearish candles that have the potential to become a bullish order block but this [03:45] time the highest top Wick is found in the third candle so this would mean in order to confirm this [03:50] as a valid bullish order block it would have to break through the high of the third bearish candle and [03:55] then as for bearish order blocks we are looking for the same break of structure but it's instead upside down [04:00] meaning we are looking to see a break of the lowest bottom Wick found in these bullish candles in order [04:05] to confirm the bearish order block is valid so now with this knowledge let's break down where we would find [04:10] the next order block within the rest of this chart structure so we first have this bullish impulsive move which [04:15] was Then followed by two bearish candles and these two bearish candles had the potential to become another bullish order [04:21] block but as we can see the following bullish move failed to push up and break the high before the [04:26] price then fell back down which means that the candles never managed to create a bullish order block but when [04:31] we look at the next bearish candle we can see that this single candle actually did create an order block [04:36] because the high of the candle was clearly broken during the bullish move that followed now you may be wondering [04:41] why we don't include these other two bearish candles within the order blocks parameters and the reason is because of [04:46] the presence of these two bullish candles that created a gap within the bearish momentum so this means the final [04:52] piece of criteria that we need to know when defining an order block is that if the order block involves [04:57] multiple candles they have to be in sequence with no opposing colored candles in between so now that we know [05:03] how to correctly identify and validate an order block the next thing we need to learn is how we find [05:08] the highest probability order block setups starting with our next step which involves overlapping order blocks with fair value gaps [05:15] so we know that in order for this order block to be valid we need to see a break of [05:19] structure through the high of these bearish candles but when it comes to determining whether this is a high probability [05:24] order block the first detail is actually found within the bullish move that created the break of structure this is [05:29] because during this impulsive move we are wanting to see the formation of a bullish fair value Gap and the [05:34] reason for this is because it shows dominance in the buying power which is important if we are intending to [05:39] use it as a support later on but the criteria that we are interested in here is the placement of [05:44] where the fair value Gap is created this is because we want to see it form within the range of [05:48] the order block as this would mean we would now have two overlapping PD arrays creating a strong bullish Confluence [05:55] within this highlighted area and then here we have another example of a bullish order block which also happened to [06:00] create a fair value Gap in the following bullish move but the difference here is that the fair value Gap [06:05] was created after the price had already moved out of the range of the order block which means in this [06:09] case we wouldn't consider this a high probability order block because it's lacking the Confluence with the fair value gap [06:16] which means only one of these PD arrays can be targeted instead of the combination of the two together and [06:21] then we have one more example here and this time we can see that the impulsive move failed to make [06:26] any form of fair value Gap at all this shows a weakness in the bullish momentum meaning this also wouldn't [06:31] be considered a high probability order block so to summarize this when a fair value Gap forms in the move [06:36] that created an order block it creates Confluence between the PD arrays which strengthens the order block setup but it's [06:42] important that the fair value Gap actually overlaps with the order block because this creates a golden zone of support [06:48] that we can Target but remember if the fair value Gap fails to form within the order block area or [06:54] it fails to create a fair value Gap at all we wouldn't consider it a high probability order block now [06:59] let's move on to the next step for finding high probability order blocks which is that you should only use [07:04] order blocks that are unmitigated here we have another example of a chart and with a little bit of analysis [07:09] we can see that there is a valid bearish order block which is also overlapping with a bearish fair value [07:14] gap which means it passes the criteria to be a high probability order block and then when we move forward [07:19] in time as expected we can see that it did end up being respected as an area of resistance so [07:25] now that we've seen this order block has been successful in creating a rejection you might then think this could [07:29] be a great resistance area to Target in the future but in reality it's more than likely that this order [07:35] block will no longer be respected and the price will simply push past it and this is because once an [07:40] order block has been attacked it then becomes mitigated which in simple terms means we do not want to use [07:45] an order block more than once this is because the reason why smart money Target order blocks for their trade [07:50] entries is because of the large amount of unfilled orders sitting in the area so when the market pushes into [07:55] an order block most of those unfilled orders will then become filled which means there is no longer a reason [08:01] for smart money to retarget the order block again in the future which is why we should also avoid reusing [08:06] the order block again too and this applies even if the market has barely pushed into the order block like [08:12] we can see in this case because it is still considered mitigated so we don't want to use it for [08:16] another setup and then another small tip worth mentioning here is that when we draw out the range of an [08:21] order block the 50% midlevel of the order block is an important level to pay attention to this is because [08:27] in terms of a bearish order block like this one here the area below the 50% mid level is typically [08:33] the most concentrated point of rejection because this is where we would find the most orders being placed but this [08:38] doesn't mean the order block will fail if the price were to dip into the upper half the lower half [08:43] is just considered a stronger area especially if the fair value Gap is also positioned in this part of the [08:48] range and then for the context of bullish order blocks this would obviously be the other way round meaning the [08:53] stronger half of the order block would be the upper half but it's important to emphasize that this doesn't mean [08:58] the other half of an order block isn't relevant it's just a helpful tip to be aware of when planning [09:03] your setups so now moving on to the next step we have another crucial piece of criteria for finding high [09:08] probability order blocks which is how we should only use order blocks that were created from a previous PD array [09:14] here we have a new chart and the first thing we should immediately notice is that the market has created [09:18] a liquidity sweep from this previous swing high and we can confirm this Sweep with this change of character that [09:24] was created during the bearish pullback that followed and now if you haven't noticed already this Market structure has actually [09:30] created a bearish order block along with an overlapping bearish fair value Gap so that makes this our first example [09:36] of a very high probability order block and this is because with the sweep on the liquidity having occurred the [09:42] market structure has signaled which direction it intends to move in next and because the order block was created as [09:47] a result of this PD array being respected it makes the order block much more likely to also be respected [09:53] because it supports the bearish directional bias of the market structure and to give another example we have this chart [09:59] here but this time the market is progressing in an uptrending structure and by using the knowledge we have learned [10:04] from our previous videos on liquidity and fair value gaps we know that in order for this bullish Trend to [10:09] continue progressing it needs to both create and find support in the bullish fair value gaps like this one here [10:15] but what's interesting is that when we analyze the move that Drew into and respected this F we can see [10:21] that it actually created another bullish order block which we can see was confirmed with the break of structure during [10:26] the following bullish leg so this is our next example of a high high probability order block because it was [10:31] created in the move that respected another PD array which in this case was a bullish fair value Gap and [10:36] going back to how we mentioned that the market wants to Target Fair Value gaps to use as support during [10:41] trending phases we can see that an overlapping bullish fair value Gap was created within the order block making this [10:47] a strong support that was then used to create the next leg up so the takeaway here is that you [10:52] should only be targeting order blocks that are created by another PD array for example this could be a sweep [10:57] on liquidity a fair value app or even another order block because this not only makes sure that the order [11:03] block is following the correct order flow but it also strengthens any other PD array that it overlaps with and [11:08] this moves us on to the next step which is that you should only trade order blocks that align with [11:13] the higher time frame Market structure here we have a 15-minute chart and within the market structure we can identify [11:19] two separate valid order blocks and each have also formed their own individual fair value gaps but the issue here [11:26] is that one of them is bullish whilst the other is bearish which means they are conflicting in their directional [11:31] bias and it's this type of scenario where a lot of Traders become confused about which PD array is more [11:37] likely to be respected so this gives us a great example as to why we must always use top-down analysis [11:43] because when we zoom out onto the 4-Hour time frame to look at the larger market structure we can actually [11:48] see that the price action is currently in the process of playing out a typical Market maker sell model this [11:54] is because we have a liquidity sweep at the top of the chart which is Then followed by a change [11:58] of character suggest sugesting that the directional bias has now switched to bearish so now looking at this chart with [12:03] both time frames side by side the price action we are seeing on the 15minute time frame is represented by [12:09] the last candle that formed on the 4-Hour time frame and with some further analysis we can see that this [12:14] 4-Hour candle actually rejected off of a 4-Hour bearish fair value Gap that was created within the 4-Hour order block [12:22] so in terms of which of the two 15-minute order blocks is more likely to be respected the answer would [12:27] be the bearish order block because it formed during the move that respected the 4-Hour bearish fair value gap which [12:33] means it aligns with the larger time frame Market structure and when we move forward in time this is exactly [12:38] what we see the price draws into the bearish order block before then creating a strong move down which completely [12:44] ignores the bullish order block
