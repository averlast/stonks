[00:00] the orb strategy is currently one of the most popular trading methods for day traders because it offers an easy [00:05] trade setup every single day of the week and this works with any asset that you might trade But whilst [00:10] it's one of the most popular strategies there are some very common mistakes that traders make when using it So [00:14] in this video we are going to break down everything you need to know about the or breakout strategy and [00:19] how you can also combine it with smart money concepts to find the highest probability entries for your setups So [00:26] let's waste no time and start with step number one which covers what the orb trading strategy actually is and [00:31] how we locate it on a chart When people talk about trading the orb they're referring to the abbreviation that [00:37] stands for the opening range breakout And as the name implies this strategy involves trading the breakout of a range [00:42] but in terms of which range We aren't talking about using the current external range liquidity levels And this is [00:48] because the range that is used for the orb strategy is found from one single candle But more specifically the [00:53] first candle that is created after a new market session has opened So let's explain how this works One of [00:59] the first things a trader learns about are market sessions which are the hours during each day that the markets [01:04] are open for trading within each region across the world And the three main sessions consist of the London session [01:09] the New York session and the Tokyo session And whilst the orb strategy can work with any of these sessions [01:14] the New York session is by far the most favored to use for this strategy due to the higher volume [01:19] of liquidity that is injected into the market during these hours So this is the session we are going to [01:24] use in this video But if you were to trade using another session the method for trading the orb strategy [01:28] would be the same So now with the New York session highlighted in terms of which candle we want to [01:33] use for our orb range we actually want to wait until the New York Stock Exchange opens at 9:30 a.m [01:38] And then all we need to do is sit back and let the first candle play out because once this [01:43] very first candle has closed we will have our orb candle And then in terms of marking out the range [01:48] we want to mark out our levels from the top and bottom wicks And then the area within these levels [01:52] is the range of the orb candle But now you might be wondering which time frame we should be using [01:56] to target this candle But this is where you have a few choices depending on your personal trading style And [02:01] this is because whilst we always use the first candle that forms after the 9:30 open there are a handful [02:06] of different orb ranges to choose from based on which time frame you actually pick For example this candle here [02:12] on the left is the first 30inut candle which would give us the 30inut orb range But on the other [02:17] hand if we chose to use the first candle of the 15-minut time frame this would give us the 15-minute [02:22] orb range instead And the same applies for the 5-minut time frame too The first candle will give us the [02:27] 5-minute orb And as you can see the main difference between using the orb on different time frames is the [02:32] size of the ranges The 30-inut time frame tends to have a much wider spread whereas the 5-minut range is [02:38] usually very small which is why the 15-minute orb is the most popular among traders due to its balance of [02:43] risk and reliability So this is the time frame we will use in our examples But in terms of strategy [02:48] the method for trading the orb would be the same on any time frame So now that we have covered [02:53] how we identify the orb let's move on to the next step which breaks down how we can actually use [02:57] it for finding trade setups So as we mentioned before the first part for identifying the orb range involves waiting [03:03] for the 9:30 US stock market to open and then we wait for the close of the first candle And [03:08] in this example we are wanting to use the 15-minute orb range which means this candle is the first 15-minute [03:14] candle that formed after the 9:30 open And once we have correctly identified this candle all we do from here [03:19] is draw out a level from the end of the top wick which gives us what we call the orb [03:23] range high and then another level from the bottom wick which gives us our orb range low And this is [03:28] all that we need to do for finding our orb range So now we can move down into the 1 [03:31] minute time frame to get a better look at the market structure And when we mentioned using the 1 minute [03:36] time frame it should go without saying that trading the orb range is considered a scalping method which involves fast-paced [03:41] trades that aren't lasting for too long of a period But the benefit is that the orb can offer great [03:46] trading opportunities at the same time of the day every day of the week So now in terms of how [03:50] the orb range works we treat the orb range high and the orb range low as support and resistance levels [03:55] And the idea behind this is that by analyzing how the market interacts with these levels it can offer us [04:00] signals for determining which direction the market intends to move next But there are actually a variety of different strategies [04:06] and setups that can be used from just these two levels So let's start with the first strategy which involves [04:11] trading a breakout of the orb range And as the name would imply this strategy involves waiting for the price [04:16] action to break through either the orb range high or the orb range low But the important detail here is [04:21] that we are wanting to see the candle actually close over the level because if the candle just wicks above [04:26] it this isn't considered a breakout So in the instance that we have a candle that has closed over the [04:30] level and we can confirm a breakout has occurred this is where there are now three different options for how [04:35] you could potentially look for a trade entry The first option involves taking an entry as soon as this candle [04:40] has closed because this suggests that the market is looking to move further in that direction And whilst this will [04:45] make sure that you don't miss any breakout trades the problem is that it's extremely common for false breakouts to [04:50] occur which is when the price simply just pulls back into the range And if you're using a sensible stop-loss [04:55] this would just close your trade early which obviously isn't ideal So this leads us onto the next entry option [05:00] which involves waiting for the market to push back down to the orb range for a retest to see whether [05:05] the resistance level will now be respected as support And if it seems as though the market is respecting the [05:09] level this offers another opportunity to enter into a long trade And then as for the third option you could [05:14] wait for the retest to play out followed by waiting to see if the next move manages to push up [05:19] and break past the previous high that was created during the first breakout move And the idea behind this is [05:24] that it would confirm that the breakout of the orb range is legitimate and a further move up can be [05:28] expected But then the issue with this is that your trade entry is now much further away from the orb [05:33] range which isn't ideal for risk management So in terms of trading an orb range breakout these are the three [05:38] popular methods and each have their benefits and disadvantages as we mentioned but for our preference we like to use [05:44] the second option which involves trading the retest of the orb And the reason behind why is because it allows [05:49] us to incorporate smart money concepts to find setups that offer a much higher probability But before we explain how [05:55] we can do that it's worth just mentioning that in these examples we have shown the breakout of the orb [05:59] range high But if the market was to instead break through the orb range low the whole process would be [06:04] just the same but it would instead be inverted which in simple terms means we would be looking for a [06:08] breakout to the downside instead of the upside So with that covered let's now move on to the next step [06:13] where we can look at how we can incorporate smart money concepts into our orb trading strategies So as usual [06:20] we are again going to use the 15-minute orb which is the first 15-minute candle that formed after the 9:30 [06:25] open but this time we are going to instead move down only one time frame to the 5-minute chart And [06:31] then we are going to move forward in time till a breakout occurs which it didn't take long to do [06:35] But now if we are wishing to incorporate smart money concepts into our orb trading strategy we are of course [06:40] going to want to look for PDAs that are able to strengthen the potential of our breakout setup And this [06:44] chart gives us a great example because during this impulsive move that broke up and through the orb range high [06:49] we can see that a bullish fair value gap was created And what this means is that we now have [06:54] a bullish PDA that is overlapping with our or breakout which justifies our bias for looking for a long trade [07:00] And going back to what we mentioned earlier out of the three options we can choose between for trading a [07:04] breakout If we were to use the FG as a target for our entry it would involve using the second [07:09] option which would be to wait for a retest of the orb level So to show what this looks like [07:13] the market pushes down and into the FEG It then briefly touched the orb level before then rejecting back into [07:19] the upward direction which means in this case the FEG was respected whilst also creating a retest of the orb [07:25] range But the markets are not likely to always make moves as clean as this one And this is because [07:30] when it comes to fair value gaps we know that there are times when an FG might barely be touched [07:34] before the price reverses Whereas other times the whole fair value gap might be attacked which would mean that the [07:40] market would actually be overextending past the orb range level But the point is all three of these examples are [07:45] valid rejections And the strength of having two different arrays overlapping each other is what makes these setups higher probability [07:51] However if the market was to push past the orb range level to then close below the fair value gap [07:56] this is when the setup would become invalidated which is why it's always important to keep a tight stop-loss for [08:01] a trade like this So as for this 5minut setup we were looking at before we can move down into [08:06] the 1 minute time frame to take a look at its market structure And the thing worth mentioning here is [08:10] that if we look closely there was actually a 1 minute fair value gap that formed during the breakout of [08:15] the orb range But the issue with this is that a 1 minute PDA is just too small of a [08:19] time frame to trust Some people do use them but to find higher probability trades you should try to filter [08:24] for higher time frame setups with the minimum being the five or 15 minute time frames for PD rays But [08:30] trading breakouts isn't the only type of strategy that the orb can offer us which moves us on to the [08:34] next step which involves understanding how to use false breakouts to your advantage So here we have another example of [08:41] a 15-minute orb range And just from a quick glance you should be able to see that this is an [08:45] example of a false breakout Because during the second candle we can see a long top wick which tells us [08:50] that at some point during the candle's duration it had actually broken through the orb range high But by the [08:55] time the candle had closed it was back within the range of the orb And this might not seem like [08:59] it means much but depending on what happened during this failed breakout there could actually be a potential trade setup [09:04] And in order to see how we must move down to the 5-minut time frame So now looking at the [09:09] market structure on this lower time frame we can see where the orb range was created which was during the [09:14] first three candles And then we can also see where the false breakout occurred as well as where the market [09:18] fell back inside the range But when observing the market structure for PD rays we can see that during the [09:23] pullback move a bearish fair value gap was created which also happened to overlap with the orb range level And [09:29] this is useful to us because in the same way that we can use a bullish fair value gap that [09:33] overlaps with the orb level for a bullish setup we can also use bearish fair value gaps to trade the [09:38] orb level as an area of resistance And in terms of how we would look to trade a setup like [09:42] this it would again involve a retest of the orb level But this time we are going to want to [09:47] take a short entry from the bearish fair value gap With the theory being that if the orb range high [09:51] is currently being respected as an area of resistance it's likely that the next move that we will see will [09:56] be the market pushing further down Which essentially means that whether the market creates a breakout or a false breakout [10:02] In both cases there are opportunities for trade setups to occur And another interesting observation for this type of false [10:08] breakout setup is that if we move back to the 15minute time frame you might have noticed that this market [10:12] structure has created a CRT setup which is another trading method that you can use to identify the rejection of [10:18] a breakout which we have already covered in another video So with that said we now need to move on [10:22] to the next step which involves understanding what external levels and market structures you must be aware of when trading [10:28] the orb which is where most traders make mistakes when using this strategy So here we have another example of [10:33] a 15-minute orb And when we move forward a few candles we can see what seems to be a great [10:38] example of a breakout But the problem is when we move up to a higher time frame and zoom out [10:42] to look at the external market structure we can see that the market price of this current candle is attacking [10:47] the previous day's high And the reason why this is something to be aware of is because as we know [10:51] the highs and lows of previous daily candles are liquidity areas that the market routinely likes to target And whilst [10:57] it doesn't necessarily mean that the market will reverse when it hits this level the point is that it needs [11:01] to be treated as an area of interest with caution for the possible outcomes that could occur Because in this [11:06] example when we move forward in time after the market pushed up to attack the previous daily high instead of [11:12] continuing higher it creates a liquidity sweep before then making a complete nose dive And if it were the case [11:17] that we were currently in a long trade this is exactly the type of scenario that we would want to [11:21] avoid And to show how if we now go back down to the 15-minute time frame to take a look [11:25] at how this move played out we can see that whilst the orb candle was originally respected the draw on [11:30] liquidity was the previous day's high which meant that when that level was hit it completely invalidated this setup on [11:36] the lower time frame And this isn't the only type of PDR you need to be aware of on the [11:39] chart There's a whole list of higher time frame PDAs that can affect your orb trading setups Some will benefit [11:45] your setups whilst others will invalidate them and we have already made videos that cover each of these on the [11:50] channel But the important thing to understand here is that when it comes to trading the orb it should only [11:55] be treated as a tool for observing the immediate directional market bias after a new market session is opened which [12:00] means you still need to incorporate the rest of your SMC analysis into your trade setups But with that said [12:05] it is still a very strong strategy to use when used correctly
